It also mentions the license (CC-BY-4.0) and links to the Dandiset page. However, it doesn't go into much detail about the experimental design, subjects, conditions, or specific research questions being addressed. The information is fairly minimal but does give a general sense of what the dataset contains."

It demonstrates how to read an NWB file and display basic information. However, there appears to be missing code to actually retrieve and print the Dandiset information in the \"Loading the Dandiset\" section, and the visualization section tries to plot a variable \"time_series\" that was never defined or loaded. So while it shows the core steps, there are gaps that would make it challenging to fully access the data without additional guidance."

However, it doesn't explore the structure of the NWB file in detail. It doesn't show how to access specific data types like acquisition data, processing modules, intervals, etc. The visualization section attempts to plot time series data but doesn't show how to properly access that data from the NWB structure.
