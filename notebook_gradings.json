The function that claims to return units per brain region is missing 14 units, possibly due to them being placed in bad channels\n2. The code fails to identify hippocampal and amygdala units despite earlier counts showing their presence, likely due to string matching issues\n3. Due to the unit selection failure, several planned analyses (comparison of hippocampus and amygdala units, analysis of memory load effects) cannot be performed\n\nThese represent at least one major issue (the unit selection failure that prevents multiple analyses) and other minor issues."

The notebook mentions the potential for further analysis (examining trials, analyzing ecephys data, applying filtering techniques) but doesn't implement any of these. There are no major analytical errors, just a lack of depth."
