In the response time vs. go cue time plot (cell 12), the x-axis label \"Go Cue Time (s)\" is probably inaccurate as it likely refers to a property relating to the delay between the go cue and target landmark.\n3. The response time plot has extreme outliers (approaching 500 seconds) that are not addressed in the analysis.\nThese constitute multiple issues with the plots, with at least one (the incorrect units labeling) being a major issue that could lead to misinterpretation."
