Based on the above, please provide a grading for the notebook.

You will respond with a series of XML blocks of the form

<grade>
<question_id>ID</question_id>
<thinking>Your rationale for the grade</thinking>
<grade>numeric grade</grade>
</grade>

where ID is the ID of the question (e.g., describe-dandiset, load-dandiset, ...), and numeric_grade is your numeric integer grade according to the rubric below. Note that the grades can be negative integers as shown below in the rubric.

Do not include any other text in your response. Just the XML blocks.

Note: Warnings in the output cells should not be considered to be issues unless they relate to other problems with the notebook.
