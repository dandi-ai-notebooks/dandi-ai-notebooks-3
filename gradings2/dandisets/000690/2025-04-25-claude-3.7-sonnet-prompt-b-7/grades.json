    {
      "question_id": "understand-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook provides a very comprehensive overview of Dandiset 000690, including its purpose (investigating visual information processing from visual cortex to hippocampus in mice), the types of data included (neural recordings, visual stimuli, behavioral measurements), and the organization of files. It explores multiple aspects of the data through code examples and visualizations, helping to understand what questions this dataset can address."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "access-data",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook clearly demonstrates how to access the data using the DANDI API, showing how to connect to the archive, retrieve assets, and load NWB files using remfile and h5py. It provides examples for accessing both the main NWB file and a probe-specific file, making it easy to understand how to work with different components of the dataset."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "work-with-nwb",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook does an excellent job of explaining the NWB structure, showing how to navigate through different groups within the files. It demonstrates accessing various data types (eye tracking, running wheel, LFP, etc.) and explains how the dataset is organized into main, image, and probe-specific NWB files."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualization-helpful",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The visualizations in the notebook are very helpful for understanding the data. There are clear plots of pupil area, eye blinks, running speed, LFP traces, and simulated neural responses to different stimuli. Each visualization is accompanied by explanatory text that helps interpret what's being shown."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualization-issues",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The visualizations are generally well-formatted with clear axes, titles, and appropriate scales. The notebook includes a few simulated visualizations (like the receptive fields and neural responses to stimuli), but these are clearly marked as simulations and are helpful for understanding potential analyses. I didn't see any visualizations that were misleading or confusing."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualization-confidence",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook provides numerous examples of how to create visualizations from the dataset, including time series plots, histograms, and spatial maps (for receptive fields). The code for these visualizations is clear and well-commented, making it easy to adapt for one's own analyses."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualization-structure",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The visualizations effectively show the structure and complexity of the data, particularly in how they demonstrate the relationships between neural activity, stimuli, and behavioral measures. The receptive field visualizations and the plots of neural responses to different stimuli help reveal important patterns in how information might be processed across brain regions."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-interpretations",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook is careful to distinguish between actual data from the dataset and simulated examples. When simulations are used (for the receptive fields and neural responses to stimuli), they are clearly labeled as such. The interpretations provided seem reasonable and well-supported by the data shown."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "redundant-examples",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "Each plot and example in the notebook seems to serve a distinct purpose, showing different aspects of the data. There's no unnecessary repetition, and each visualization adds something new to the understanding of the dataset."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "notebook-clarity",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook is very clear and well-structured, with logical progression from basic dataset information to more complex analyses. Each section is well-explained with both code and markdown text providing context. The code is well-commented and the outputs are clearly presented."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "code-reusability",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The code in the notebook is highly reusable and adaptable. It provides clear examples for connecting to the DANDI API, loading and exploring NWB files, and creating various types of visualizations. The code is modular and well-structured, making it easy to adapt for exploring other aspects of the dataset."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "exploration-guidance",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook provides excellent guidance for further exploration of the dataset. The final section specifically outlines key research questions that can be addressed with this data, along with pseudo-code examples of analysis approaches. It clearly suggests ways to compare responses across brain regions, analyze stimulus selectivity, and correlate neural activity with behavior."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "overall-helpfulness",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "Overall, this notebook is extremely helpful for getting started with this Dandiset. It provides a comprehensive introduction to the dataset's content and structure, demonstrates how to access and visualize different types of data, and offers clear guidance for further analyses. The combination of actual data exploration and simulated examples provides a thorough understanding of what's possible with this dataset."
