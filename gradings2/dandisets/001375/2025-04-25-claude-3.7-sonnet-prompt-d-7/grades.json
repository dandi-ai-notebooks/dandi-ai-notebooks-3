  "image_descriptions": "# Description of Images in the Notebook\n\n### Figure 1: Trial/Lap Duration Distribution\n- **Overview**: This histogram shows the distribution of trial/lap durations for the mouse running in a virtual hallway, measured in seconds.\n- **Observations**: Most trials last around 10-15 seconds, with a sharp peak at the lowest duration bin. There's a heavy right skew with some outliers extending beyond 150 seconds.\n- **Minor Issues**: None; the axes are clearly labeled, and the plot has a title and grid.\n- **Consistency with Text**: Matches the text's statement that most trials last 10-15 seconds.\n\n### Figure 2: Trial Durations Over Time\n- **Overview**: This scatter plot shows how trial durations varied throughout the recording session, with time in minutes on the x-axis and duration in seconds on the y-axis.\n- **Observations**: Most trials remain under 20 seconds throughout the session. There's one notable outlier around the 45-minute mark where a trial lasted over 160 seconds.\n- **Minor Issues**: None; plotting is clear with well-labeled axes and title.\n- **Consistency with Text**: Consistent with the notebook's narrative.\n\n### Figure 3: Spike Count Distribution Across Units\n- **Overview**: This histogram shows the distribution of total spike counts across all sorted neurons (units).\n- **Observations**: Most units have fewer than 50,000 spikes, with a peak in the first bin. A few units have much higher spike counts (over 250,000).\n- **Minor Issues**: None; the plot has clear labels and is well-formatted.\n- **Consistency with Text**: Consistent with the text's reporting of spike count statistics.\n\n### Figure 4: Average Firing Rate Distribution Across Units\n- **Overview**: This histogram shows the distribution of average firing rates (in Hz) across all sorted neurons.\n- **Observations**: Most units fire at less than 10 Hz on average, with a few units showing much higher firing rates (up to 60 Hz).\n- **Minor Issues**: None; the visualization is clear and well-labeled.\n- **Consistency with Text**: Matches the statistics described in the text about varying firing rates.\n\n### Figure 5: Raw Electrophysiology Data\n- **Overview**: This plot shows 100ms of raw electrophysiology data from the first 5 channels, with time on the x-axis and amplitude (in mV) on the y-axis.\n- **Observations**: The channels show oscillatory activity with different patterns. The traces are vertically offset for clarity.\n- **Minor Issues**: None; the plot has clear labels, legend, and appropriate scaling.\n- **Consistency with Text**: The plot aligns with the text's description of raw data visualization.\n\n### Figure 6: Frequency Content of Raw Data\n- **Overview**: This log-scale plot shows the frequency content (up to 1000 Hz) of the first 3 channels based on FFT analysis.\n- **Observations**: Higher power at lower frequencies with a general decline as frequency increases, typical of neural data. There are frequency-specific peaks and dips throughout.\n- **Minor Issues**: None; appropriate log scaling and clearly labeled axes.\n- **Consistency with Text**: Consistent with the broader discussion of raw data analysis.\n\n### Figure 7: Inter-Spike Interval (ISI) Distributions\n- **Overview**: Three histograms showing the distribution of time intervals between consecutive spikes for three different units.\n- **Observations**: All units show refractory periods at very short intervals, but their overall firing patterns differ significantly. Unit 32 has many more short intervals (indicating higher firing rate) than Units 0 and 16.\n- **Minor Issues**: None; the visualizations are clear with appropriate axes and titles.\n- **Consistency with Text**: The plots illustrate the text's point about visible refractory periods and different firing patterns.\n\n### Figure 8: Peri-Event Time Histogram\n- **Overview**: This plot shows how the firing rates of three selected units change around trial start times.\n- **Observations**: Unit 32 (green) shows much higher firing rates than the other units and clear modulation around trial starts. Unit 16 (orange) shows a specific peak around 3-4 seconds after trial start.\n- **Minor Issues**: None; clear labeling and appropriate formatting.\n- **Consistency with Text**: Aligns with the text's description of showing how neural activity is modulated by behavioral tasks.\n\n### Figure 9: Spike Raster Plots\n- **Overview**: Three raster plots showing spike times for three different units across the first 30 trials, with each row representing a different trial.\n- **Observations**: Unit 32 fires much more frequently than the other units. Some trials show clear patterns of activity, with varying density of spikes across trials for all units.\n- **Minor Issues**: None; the visualization is clear with appropriate axes and titles.\n- **Consistency with Text**: Consistent with the description of visualizing neural activity distribution across trials.\n\n### Figure 10: Trial Duration vs. Firing Rate\n- **Overview**: Three scatter plots showing the relationship between trial duration and firing rate for three different units.\n- **Observations**: For all units, there appears to be a slight negative correlation between trial duration and firing rate, with higher firing rates typically occurring during shorter trials. The relationship is not strongly linear.\n- **Minor Issues**: None; clear visualization with well-labeled axes.\n- **Consistency with Text**: The text states \"No clear correlation was observed between trial duration and firing rate,\" which is somewhat inconsistent with the visible trend of higher firing rates during shorter trials. The relationship is subtle but appears to exist in the plots.",
