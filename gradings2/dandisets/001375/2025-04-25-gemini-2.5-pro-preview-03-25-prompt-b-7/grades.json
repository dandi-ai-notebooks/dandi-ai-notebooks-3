  "image_descriptions": "# Description of Images in the Notebook\n\n## Figure 1: Histogram of Trial Durations\n\n**Overview:**\nThis figure shows a histogram displaying the distribution of trial durations (in seconds) from the Dandiset. The x-axis represents duration in seconds (0-160), and the y-axis shows the number of trials in each duration bin.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n- The distribution is heavily right-skewed, with the vast majority of trials (>300) having durations less than 20 seconds\n- There's a steep drop-off after the first bin, with only about 50 trials in the 10-20 second range\n- Very few trials exceed 40 seconds in duration\n- The longest trials appear to extend to around 160 seconds, but are extremely rare\n\n**Minor Issues:**\nNone - the figure is well-formatted with clear labels, appropriate grid lines, and a descriptive title.\n\n**Major Issues:**\nNone - the figure effectively conveys the trial duration distribution.\n\n**Consistency with Text:**\nThe text accurately describes the histogram as showing that \"most trials appear to be relatively short, with a tail of longer trials (right-skewed distribution).\"\n\n## Figure 2: Raw Ephys Data Segment\n\n**Overview:**\nThis figure displays raw electrophysiology voltage traces for the first 5 channels over a 1-second time period. Each channel is plotted with a vertical offset to allow clear visualization of all traces simultaneously.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n- The traces show neural voltage fluctuations, likely representing local field potentials or background neural activity\n- All 5 channels show similar oscillation patterns, suggesting they might be recording from nearby sites\n- The data appears to have a temporal structure with notable voltage deflections around 0.4-0.5 seconds\n\n**Minor Issues:**\nNone - the figure is well-formatted with each channel clearly labeled (Ch 0-4), appropriate time axis (0-1 seconds), and voltage axis that indicates both the unit (mV) and the presence of offsets.\n\n**Major Issues:**\nNone - the visualization successfully demonstrates how to access and plot a small segment of the high-resolution voltage recordings.\n\n**Consistency with Text:**\nThe text accurately describes the plot as showing \"voltage traces for the first second of recording on the first 5 channels\" with \"voltage fluctuations, likely representing neural activity like local field potentials (LFP) or background noise.\"\n\n## Figure 3: Raster Plot of Neural Spikes\n\n**Overview:**\nThis figure shows a raster plot of spike times for 10 units (neurons) over a 60-second period. Each row represents a different unit, and each vertical line represents the time of an action potential (spike).\n\n**Key Observations:**\n- Different units show distinct firing patterns and rates\n- Some units (like 3 and 5) appear to have very high firing rates, appearing as dense black lines\n- Others (like 1 and 4) have much sparser activity\n- There appear to be some coordinated changes in firing patterns across units at certain times\n\n**Minor Issues:**\nNone - the figure has clear labeling, appropriate time range, and distinguishes between the different units effectively.\n\n**Major Issues:**\nNone - the raster plot effectively visualizes the spike timing data.\n\n**Consistency with Text:**\nThe text accurately describes the raster plot as showing \"each spike as a vertical tick mark\" with each row representing \"a different putative neuron (unit).\" It also correctly notes that \"some units have very high firing rates, appearing as dense black lines.\"\n\n## Figure 4: Electrode Locations\n\n**Overview:**\nThis figure displays the spatial arrangement of the recording electrodes in the probe. The x and y coordinates show the physical positioning (in \u03bcm), and different colors/markers indicate different electrode groups (shanks).\n\n**Key Observations:**\n- The probe appears to have two shanks (shank1 and shank2)\n- Electrodes are arranged in a linear configuration along the y-axis\n- The shanks are positioned very close to each other horizontally (along the x-axis)\n- The probe spans approximately 2000 \u03bcm vertically\n\n**Minor Issues:**\nNone - the figure has clear axis labels with units (\u03bcm), appropriate legend, and equal aspect ratio to accurately represent the physical layout.\n\n**Major Issues:**\nNone - the visualization effectively shows the electrode arrangement.\n\n**Consistency with Text:**\nThe text accurately describes the scatter plot as displaying \"the spatial layout of the recording electrodes, often grouped by probe shanks (as seen here with 'shank1' and 'shank2').\" It correctly notes that this helps visualize \"the physical arrangement of the recording sites relative to each other.\"",
