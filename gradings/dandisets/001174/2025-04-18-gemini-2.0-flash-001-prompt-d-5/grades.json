    {
      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook appears to describe the Dandiset reasonably well. It introduces DANDI ID 001174, explains that it contains calcium imaging data from SMA and M1 regions of macaque monkeys, and mentions the experimental paradigm (rest and arm-reaching task). While this provides good context, it doesn't go into extensive detail about the dataset's full contents, experimental design, or potential applications, which would be needed for a \"very well\" rating."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook does a good job showing how to load the Dandiset information. It uses the dandi-api library to connect to the archive, retrieves a list of assets, displays the total number of assets, and shows the paths of the first five assets. It also demonstrates how to get specific file information including asset ID and URL. This provides users with a clear understanding of how to access the Dandiset programmatically."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook effectively demonstrates loading basic information from an NWB file in the Dandiset. It shows how to use pynwb, h5py, and remfile to access a specific NWB file remotely and extract basic metadata such as session description, identifier, and start time. This provides a good foundation for understanding the file's contents."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook demonstrates loading at least three independent pieces of data from the NWB file:\n1. OnePhotonSeries data (mean fluorescence over time)\n2. Image masks from the PlaneSegmentation\n3. Fluorescence traces from the RoiResponseSeries for three different ROIs\nThis shows a good range of data types being loaded from the NWB file."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook visualizes three distinct types of data from the NWB file:\n1. Mean fluorescence over time (from OnePhotonSeries)\n2. Maximum projection of image masks (from PlaneSegmentation)\n3. Fluorescence traces for three ROIs (from RoiResponseSeries)\nThis demonstrates good coverage of visualizing different aspects of the data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "advanced-visualization",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook doesn't appear to create any advanced visualizations that combine multiple types of data. Each visualization focuses on a single data type (mean fluorescence, image masks, or individual ROI traces). An advanced visualization might have combined spatial information from the masks with temporal activity patterns, or related neuronal activity to behavioral data, etc. The visualizations presented are relatively basic."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The plots in the notebook appear to be of reasonably good quality. They display the relevant data clearly, though there are some opportunities for improvement. For example, the image masks visualization could show individual ROIs more clearly, and the fluorescence plots could benefit from additional context (e.g., specifying if values represent raw fluorescence or dF/F)."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "There are some minor issues with the plots:\n1. The image masks plot doesn't clearly show if it's displaying all ROIs or just which ROI has the highest value in each pixel\n2. The y-axis label in the fluorescence trace plot doesn't specify whether the values represent raw fluorescence or dF/F\n3. The arbitrary selection of the first three ROIs for visualization rather than using some meaningful selection criteria\nThese are all minor issues that don't significantly impair understanding but could be improved."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "analysis-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "There are some minor analysis issues in the notebook:\n1. The sudden drop in fluorescence at around 35 seconds isn't thoroughly investigated\n2. The analysis is limited to only the first 1000 frames for the mean fluorescence calculation without clear justification\n3. The selection of ROIs is arbitrary rather than based on specific analytical criteria\n4. The notebook doesn't connect the image masks with the fluorescence traces in a meaningful way\nThese issues don't invalidate the analysis but represent missed opportunities for deeper insight."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook doesn't appear to draw any major unsupported conclusions. It presents observations about the data (e.g., differences in activity patterns between ROIs, noting a drop in mean fluorescence) without making strong claims about their significance or causes. The interpretations provided are generally cautious and appropriate given the exploratory nature of the analysis."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "There are some minor additional issues:\n1. The notebook doesn't fully investigate the suspicious drop in mean fluorescence around the 35-second mark\n2. The analysis is somewhat basic and doesn't progress to more sophisticated techniques that are mentioned in the conclusion (e.g., spike detection, correlation analysis)\n3. The notebook could provide more guidance on how to extend the analysis beyond the basic visualizations presented\nThese issues don't significantly detract from the notebook's value but represent areas for improvement."
