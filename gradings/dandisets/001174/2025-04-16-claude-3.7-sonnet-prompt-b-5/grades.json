    {
      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook provides a reasonably good description of the Dandiset. It mentions the Dandiset ID (001174), data modality (calcium imaging), brain regions studied (SMA and M1), and experimental context (resting or arm reaching). The notebook also prints basic information about the Dandiset including its ID, name, and a brief description that explains the rationale for the study and experimental approach. However, while the description is adequate, it doesn't go into extensive detail about the experimental design, subject population, or other aspects that would constitute a very thorough description."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook demonstrates how to load information about the Dandiset very well. It uses direct Dandiset ID reference, prints basic information (ID, name, description), and explains the organization of the dataset by subject and session. It also clearly specifies which NWB file will be used (subject Q, session 20220915) and shows how to access the asset URL. The code effectively demonstrates how to access the Dandiset information without requiring a full download."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook shows very well how to load basic information from an NWB file. It demonstrates streaming the file directly from the URL using remfile, h5py, and pynwb. It extracts and prints basic session information (description, start time, creation date) and subject information (ID, species, sex, age). It also explores the structure of the NWB file, identifying available data within acquisition, processing, and devices sections. This provides a comprehensive overview of the NWB file's metadata and structure."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook demonstrates loading multiple pieces of data from the NWB file:\n1. Raw calcium imaging data from the OnePhotonSeries object\n2. ROI masks from the ImageSegmentation and PlaneSegmentation objects\n3. Fluorescence traces from the Fluorescence and RoiResponseSeries objects\n4. Event amplitude data from the EventAmplitude object\nThese are all independent pieces of data from the NWB file, exceeding the requirement for three pieces of data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook demonstrates visualizing several independent pieces of data:\n1. Single frame of raw calcium imaging data\n2. Multiple frames (4) of raw calcium imaging data at different timepoints\n3. ROI masks for 9 individual ROIs\n4. Composite image of all ROI masks\n5. Event amplitude traces for selected ROIs\n6. Total neural activity across all ROIs over time\n7. Correlation matrix heatmap between ROIs\nThis exceeds the requirement for three independent visualizations."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The plots in the notebook are generally of very good quality. They include appropriate titles, axis labels, colorbars for images, and legends when necessary. The visualizations effectively communicate the data being presented, whether it's individual frames, ROI masks, time series data, or correlation patterns. The use of different visualization types (images, line plots, heatmaps) is appropriate for the different data types being presented. The technical quality of the visualizations appears high based on the descriptions."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "There are some minor issues with the plots. In cells 23 and 25, the ROI masks have a shape of (40, 292, 179), but the visualization only uses two dimensions and doesn't fully utilize the weights of the mask. In cell 46, the network visualization plot is essentially blank due to underlying correlation matrix issues with constant inputs, making this visualization ineffective. These issues impact the clarity and accuracy of some visualizations but don't prevent understanding of the main data features."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "analysis-issues",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "There are major issues with the analysis, particularly in the correlation and network analysis sections. In cell 43, the code calculates Pearson correlations without handling constant inputs properly, leading to NaN values in the correlation matrix. This issue propagates to cell 46, resulting in a blank network visualization that provides no meaningful information. Cell 44 claims to identify clusters of neurons with similar activity patterns, but this is not supported by the visualization which shows mostly near-zero correlations. These issues significantly impact the validity of the correlation and network analyses."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "The notebook contains some unsupported conclusions. In cell 44, it claims \"We can identify clusters of neurons with similar activity patterns,\" but this isn't supported by the visualization which shows mostly near-zero correlations. In cell 47, it attempts to interpret a blank graph as a dendrogram, which is completely incorrect. In cell 48, it concludes \"The data reveals clear patterns of neural activity, with distinct events visible in individual neurons and periods of coordinated activity across the population,\" which is only partially supported by the visualizations and contradicted by the network analysis showing almost no network activity. These represent major unsupported conclusions that could mislead readers about the data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "There are some minor issues in the notebook:\n1. In cells 16 and 22, the markdown cells reference variables (`one_photon_series.data.shape`, `one_photon_series.rate`, `len(plane_segmentation)`) that were defined in previous code cells. While this works, it would be better practice to either rewrite the text in a way that doesn't depend on variable substitution or to redefine the variables in these cells.\n2. The notebook doesn't properly address the presence of NaN values in the fluorescence data when calculating correlations.\nThese are minor issues that don't significantly impact the overall functionality or understanding of the notebook."
