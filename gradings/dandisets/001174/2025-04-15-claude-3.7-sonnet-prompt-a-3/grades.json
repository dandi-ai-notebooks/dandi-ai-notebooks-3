    {
      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook describes the Dandiset very well. Cells 1-3 provide a thorough introduction to the Dandiset, including its ID (001174), the brain regions studied (SMA and M1), species (macaques), imaging method (calcium imaging with miniature microscopes and GCaMP6f), and the task (arm reaching). It also mentions the potential value for understanding human motor control and movement disorders. This provides excellent context for the notebook."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook shows how to load information about the Dandiset very well. Cell 7 connects to the DANDI archive using DandiAPIClient, retrieves the specific Dandiset (001174), extracts its metadata, and displays the Dandiset ID, name, and description. It also retrieves and displays information about the assets (NWB files) within the Dandiset. Cell 8 describes the selection of a specific NWB file for further analysis."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook shows how to load basic information from an NWB file very well. Cell 9 loads the selected NWB file using remfile and pynwb, and prints key metadata about the session and subject. Cell 11 explores the structure of the NWB file, printing the available acquisition data streams, processing modules, and data interfaces. This provides a clear understanding of how to access and explore the basic structure of an NWB file."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook shows how to load multiple pieces of data from an NWB file effectively. It loads: 1) raw calcium imaging data (Cell 15), 2) ROI spatial footprints/masks (Cells 17-19), 3) fluorescence time series data (Cells 23-25), and 4) event amplitude data (Cell 27). These represent distinct and independent pieces of data from the NWB file, and the notebook clearly demonstrates how to access and use each of them."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook visualizes multiple pieces of data from the NWB file effectively. It shows: 1) raw calcium imaging frames (Cell 15), 2) ROI spatial footprints as both a combined visualization (Cell 19) and individual ROIs (Cell 21), 3) fluorescence time series for selected ROIs (Cell 25), 4) event amplitude data (Cell 27), 5) a heatmap of neural activity over time (Cell 29), and 6) a correlation matrix between neurons (Cell 31). These represent multiple independent visualizations of different aspects of the data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "advanced-visualization",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook creates an advanced visualization in Cell 35, which combines spatial and temporal information about the neurons. It calculates the centroid of each ROI's mask, computes the average activity within a specific time window, normalizes the activity, and overlays a scatter plot of the ROI centroids (color-coded by activity level) on top of an average frame of the raw calcium imaging data. This effectively combines structural and functional information in a single visualization."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The plots in the notebook are generally of very good quality. They include appropriate axes labels, titles, and colorbars where needed. The visualizations effectively communicate the data they represent, such as the spatial distribution of ROIs, the temporal patterns of neural activity, and the relationships between neurons. The code handles edge cases well, such as missing masks or normalization issues."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "There is one minor issue with the plots in Cell 33, where the correlation coefficient is displayed as 'nan', and the most correlated and most anti-correlated pairs are identified as the same ROIs (ROI 1 and ROI 2). This is likely due to the sparse nature of the signals and how the correlation matrix was processed. However, this doesn't significantly detract from the overall quality of the notebook, as it's a single issue and doesn't affect the other visualizations."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "analysis-issues",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "There are no major issues with the analysis. The notebook performs standard and appropriate analyses for calcium imaging data, including visualization of raw data, ROI masks, fluorescence time series, event amplitudes, and correlation between neurons. The cell-by-cell critique did note that the correlation analysis in Cell 33 produced 'nan' values, but this is more of a plot issue than an analysis issue, as it seems to be related to how the results were displayed rather than a fundamental error in the analysis approach."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook does not draw any unsupported conclusions. It primarily focuses on data exploration and visualization, rather than making specific claims about the data. The summary in Cell 36 reiterates the analyses performed and the potential value of the dataset, which is supported by the content of the notebook. The future directions suggested in Cell 37 are reasonable and do not make unsupported claims about what the data might show."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "There are no other significant issues with the notebook. The code executes without major errors, the visualizations are effective, and the narrative flow is clear. The notebook accomplishes its stated goal of providing a starting point for researchers analyzing calcium imaging data from non-human primates."
