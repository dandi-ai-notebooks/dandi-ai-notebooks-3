  "grades": [
    {
      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook provides a good description of the Dandiset 001174, identifying it as calcium imaging in the SMA and M1 regions of macaque monkeys during rest and arm reaching tasks. It mentions the use of miniature microscopes for data collection. This gives users a clear understanding of the dataset's content and purpose."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook effectively uses the DandiAPIClient to connect to the DANDI archive, retrieve Dandiset \"001174\", and list the first five assets. This demonstrates the basic steps to access information about the Dandiset."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook shows how to load an NWB file from the Dandiset using remfile and h5py, and then inspects basic metadata (session_description, identifier, session_start_time, timestamps_reference_time). This demonstrates the fundamental steps for accessing NWB file information."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook shows loading at least two independent pieces of data from the NWB file: 1) the calcium imaging data from OnePhotonSeries and 2) the image masks from PlaneSegmentation. This demonstrates accessing different types of data within the NWB file."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook visualizes at least two independent pieces of data: 1) the mean intensity of calcium imaging data over time, 2) the mean intensity for the first 100 frames, and 3) a heatmap of image masks. Each visualization shows different aspects of the data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "advanced-visualization",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "While the notebook creates multiple visualizations, none of them combine different types of data from the NWB file. The visualizations are relatively simple and show one data type at a time rather than creating an advanced visualization that integrates multiple data types."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The plots have appropriate titles, axes labels (in most cases), and clearly show the data. However, they lack some context that would help with interpretation, particularly the image masks plot which doesn't have axis labels."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "There are some minor issues with the plots: 1) The mean intensity plot shows unusual downward spikes without explanation, 2) The \"Trial 1\" plot has a potentially misleading title as there's no clear definition of what constitutes a trial, and 3) The image masks plot lacks axis labels and sufficient context for interpretation."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "analysis-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "There are a few minor issues with the analysis: the notebook does not explain the unusual downward spikes in the mean intensity data, and there's limited interpretation of the visualized data. However, the basic data handling and calculations appear to be correct."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook doesn't appear to draw any major unsupported conclusions. It primarily focuses on demonstrating how to access and visualize the data without making significant claims about the data's meaning or implications."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "There are some minor issues: 1) In Cell 17, only the output of the last call is displayed which could be confusing, and 2) The notebook could benefit from more explanations about the data interpretation and the scientific context of the visualizations."
