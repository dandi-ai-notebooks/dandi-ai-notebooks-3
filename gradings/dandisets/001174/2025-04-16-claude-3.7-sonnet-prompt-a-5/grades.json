    {
      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook does an excellent job of describing the Dandiset. It provides a comprehensive overview in Cell 3 explaining the data modalities (calcium imaging with miniature microscopes), brain regions (SMA and M1), tasks (resting and arm-reaching), and the scientific goals. It also includes a link to the dataset on Neurosift and sets clear context for the reader."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook demonstrates loading the Dandiset very well through Cells 7-10. It uses the DANDI API to connect to the archive, retrieve the Dandiset with ID \"001174\", list the assets, and display relevant information. It also shows how to filter for a specific NWB file within the Dandiset."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook effectively demonstrates loading an NWB file in Cells 11-12 using remote file access with remfile and h5py, and then reading it with pynwb. It also shows how to examine basic metadata from the loaded file in Cells 13-14, displaying session information and subject details."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook loads multiple independent pieces of data from the NWB file:\n1. Raw imaging data (OnePhotonSeries) in Cell 18\n2. ROI masks from the PlaneSegmentation object in Cells 22-24\n3. Fluorescence traces (RoiResponseSeries) in Cell 26\n4. Event amplitude data in Cell 30\nThis demonstrates thorough exploration of the NWB file's data structures."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook visualizes multiple independent pieces of data:\n1. Raw imaging frames in Cell 20 (four example frames)\n2. ROI masks in Cell 24 (background frame and five individual ROI masks)\n3. Fluorescence traces for five ROIs in Cell 28\n4. Comparison of fluorescence trace and event amplitude for a single ROI in Cell 32\n5. Correlation matrix heatmap between ROIs in Cell 34\nThis shows comprehensive visualization of different aspects of the data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "advanced-visualization",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "Cell 34 creates an advanced visualization showing the correlation matrix between ROIs as a heatmap, and Cell 32 attempts to compare fluorescence traces with event amplitudes. However, the event detection is not working well, and the correlation analysis doesn't yield meaningful results. While these are attempts at advanced visualizations, they don't effectively combine multiple types of data in an insightful way."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The plots are generally of reasonable quality, with appropriate labels, titles, and color schemes. For example, Cell 28 shows well-presented fluorescence traces with proper offsets for visibility. However, there are some issues with the quality of plots, such as non-uniform illumination in the raw imaging frames (Cell 20) and crowded tick labels in the correlation heatmap (Cell 34)."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "There are several minor issues with the plots:\n1. The raw imaging frames in Cell 20 have non-uniform illumination that could benefit from better normalization.\n2. In Cell 24, there's an indexing inconsistency between the ROI numbering in the titles and the actual data.\n3. The correlation heatmap in Cell 34 has crowded axis labels.\n4. There's a warning from plt.tight_layout() mentioned for Cell 20.\nThese are all minor issues that don't significantly impact understanding the data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "analysis-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "There are some minor issues with the analysis:\n1. In Cell 24, there's an off-by-one error in indexing the ROI masks.\n2. In Cell 32, the event detection doesn't work well, possibly due to inappropriate thresholds.\n3. In Cell 34, the correlation analysis doesn't yield meaningful results, and downsampling might be too aggressive.\n4. The different sampling rates between fluorescence and event amplitude data (noted in Cell 30) are not addressed when comparing them.\nThese issues don't invalidate the analysis but limit its effectiveness."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook is generally cautious about drawing conclusions, especially when the analysis doesn't yield clear results (e.g., in Cells 34-36 regarding correlation). The summary in Cell 37 appropriately reflects what was covered without making unsupported claims. There are no instances of unsupported conclusions being drawn."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "There are a few minor issues not covered in the previous categories:\n1. In Cell 16, the indicator and location fields show \"N/A\", which could be investigated further.\n2. In Cell 31-32, there's confusion in comments between using 2 or 5 minutes for the time window.\n3. The shape mismatch between ROI masks (292, 179) and image dimensions (320, 200) noted in Cell 24 is not addressed.\nThese are minor issues that don't significantly impact the overall quality of the notebook."
