      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook does an excellent job describing the Dandiset. Cells 1 and 3 provide comprehensive information about the dataset, including the brain regions (SMA and M1), species (macaque monkeys), data modality (calcium imaging), and experimental tasks (resting and arm-reaching). Cell 3 specifically gives a very good brief overview of the data and includes a link to Neurosift. The description is thorough and helps readers understand the context of the data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook demonstrates loading the Dandiset information very effectively. Cells 7-10 show how to use the DANDI API to connect to the archive, retrieve the specific Dandiset (001174), list the assets, and select a specific asset. The code prints essential information including the number of assets, Dandiset name and description, and details about specific assets. This approach is comprehensive and well-executed."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook shows how to load an NWB file excellently. Cells 11-14 demonstrate loading the NWB file using remote file access (avoiding a full download), which is an efficient approach. The code uses remfile, h5py, and pynwb to access the file and extract basic metadata such as session ID, description, start time, file creation date, and subject information. The notebook also explores the imaging device information and imaging plane characteristics in cells 15-16."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook loads multiple independent pieces of data from the NWB file:\n1. Raw imaging data from OnePhotonSeries (cell 18)\n2. ROI segmentation data including masks (cells 22-24)\n3. Fluorescence traces (cell 26)\n4. Event amplitude data (cell 30)\nThis exceeds the requirement for three independent pieces of data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook visualizes multiple independent pieces of data:\n1. Raw imaging frames at different time points (cell 20)\n2. ROI masks for individual ROIs (cell 24)\n3. Fluorescence traces for multiple ROIs (cell 28)\n4. Comparison of fluorescence trace and event amplitudes for a single ROI (cell 32)\n5. Correlation matrix of fluorescence activity between ROIs (cell 34)\nThis exceeds the requirement for three visualizations."

    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The plots in the notebook are of reasonably good quality. They include appropriate axes labels, titles, and color bars where needed. However, there are some issues noted: the raw imaging frames show non-uniform illumination that could benefit from better normalization; the plot labels in the correlation heatmap are too dense making it hard to read; and there's a warning from plt.tight_layout() suggesting layout issues. While functional, the plots could be improved in terms of visual clarity and information presentation."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "Several minor issues with plots were noted:\n1. In cell 20, there's non-uniform illumination in the raw images that could benefit from better normalization or contrast enhancement\n2. In cell 20, there's a warning from plt.tight_layout() indicating layout issues\n3. In cell 24, there's an off-by-one error in ROI mask indexing/labeling\n4. In cell 32, there's some confusion in the code comments about time ranges (2 vs 5 minutes)\n5. In cell 34, the axis labels are too dense making the correlation heatmap harder to read\nNone of these are major issues that completely invalidate the plots, but they do affect the quality and clarity."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "analysis-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "There are a few minor analysis issues in the notebook:\n1. In cell 16, indicator and location fields show \"N/A\" - this might be worth investigating to ensure complete metadata analysis\n2. In cell 24, there's a mismatch between ROI mask shape (292, 179) and image dimensions (320, 200) without addressing alignment\n3. In cell 30, there's a slight difference in sampling rates between datasets (10.00373 Hz vs 10 Hz) which is noted but not addressed in the analysis\n4. In cell 32, the event detection is not working as expected, resulting in only raw event amplitude being plotted\n5. In cell 34, the correlation analysis doesn't yield meaningful results, possibly due to aggressive downsampling or time window selection\n\nThese are methodological issues that affect the analysis quality but don't completely invalidate the notebook's approach or conclusions."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook is generally careful about its conclusions. When analyses don't yield the expected results (such as the correlation analysis in cell 34 and attempted visualization in cell 36), the notebook honestly acknowledges this rather than forcing unfounded interpretations. The summary in cell 37 makes reasonable statements about what was found and suggests appropriate future directions. There are no instances where the notebook draws conclusions that aren't supported by the data shown."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "There are no significant other issues beyond what has been covered in the previous criteria. The notebook flows well, has a clear structure with introduction, methods, results, and conclusion sections, and includes defensive programming practices (like gracefully handling the case where no correlated ROIs were found). The code is generally well-documented with comments, and the markdown cells provide good context for each analysis step."
