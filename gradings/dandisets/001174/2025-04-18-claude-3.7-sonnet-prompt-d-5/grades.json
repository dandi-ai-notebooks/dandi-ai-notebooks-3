      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook does a very good job describing the Dandiset. Cell 1 introduces Dandiset 001174, explains the experimental context (calcium imaging in macaque SMA and M1), highlights scientific goals, and provides a link to the dataset on Neurosift. Cell 4 further extracts and presents the Dandiset's metadata including ID, version, name, and description. Cell 21 also acknowledges the data contributors."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook demonstrates loading the Dandiset information very well. Cell 3 introduces the section on loading the Dandiset using the DANDI API. Cell 4 successfully uses the DANDI API to connect to the archive, retrieves the Dandiset object, prints the ID and version, extracts metadata, and lists available assets with their sizes. The implementation includes a fallback mechanism for metadata, which is good practice."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook does an excellent job showing how to load basic information from an NWB file. Cells 5-7 demonstrate the process of selecting an NWB file from the Dandiset and loading it using appropriate libraries (remfile, h5py, pynwb). The notebook prints basic file information including session description, start time, subject details. It also explores OnePhotonSeries and ImagingPlane objects in Cell 9, showing various attributes of the imaging data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook demonstrates loading multiple independent pieces of data from the NWB file: 1) ROI masks/cell footprints (Cells 10-11), 2) fluorescence traces (Cells 13-14), and 3) event amplitude data (Cells 16-17). For each data type, it retrieves the relevant information and provides details about the data's properties."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook visualizes three independent pieces of data: 1) ROI masks both individually and combined (Cell 12), 2) fluorescence traces for each ROI over time (Cell 15), and 3) event amplitude traces for each ROI over a longer time window (Cell 18). Each visualization includes appropriate labels, titles, and formatting."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The plots in the notebook are of very good quality. The ROI mask visualizations in Cell 12 use appropriate colormaps with colorbars and include individual ROI plots plus a combined view with different colors for each ROI. The fluorescence traces (Cell 15) and event amplitude traces (Cell 18) are normalized and offset for better visibility, with clear labels, titles, legends, and grids. The plots effectively communicate the data's characteristics."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "There are no significant issues with the plots. All visualizations are properly labeled, use appropriate scaling, and effectively represent the data. The notebook handles cases where data might not be available (e.g., checking for valid ROIs before attempting correlation analysis)."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "analysis-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "The main issue is that the correlation analysis in Cell 20 couldn't be completed because no ROIs with meaningful variance were detected. This appears to be a limitation of the specific data subset being examined rather than a flaw in the analysis approach. The notebook handles this situation gracefully by providing an informative message rather than producing an error."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "The notebook generally avoids making unsupported conclusions. However, in Cell 21 (the summary), it mentions \"computing correlations between ROI activity\" as one of the completed tasks, even though this analysis couldn't be completed due to the lack of variance in the ROIs. This could be considered a minor unsupported conclusion."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "There's one minor issue noted in the critique: Cell 21 mentions computing ROI correlations as an accomplished objective, but this wasn't completed due to data limitations. This is a minor inconsistency between the summary and the actual analysis performed. However, the notebook otherwise handles edge cases well and includes appropriate notes and explanations throughout."
