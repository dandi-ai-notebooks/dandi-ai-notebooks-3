      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook does a very good job describing the Dandiset. Cell 1 introduces the Dandiset (001174), describes the experimental context (calcium imaging in macaque SMA and M1), highlights the scientific goals, provides a link to the dataset, and outlines the notebook's objectives. Cell 4 further expands on this by retrieving and printing the Dandiset ID, version, name, and description using the DANDI API. The final cell also summarizes the dataset effectively."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook demonstrates how to load information about the Dandiset very well. Cell 3 introduces the section on loading the Dandiset. Cell 4 uses the DANDI API to connect to the archive, retrieve the Dandiset object, print the ID and version, extract metadata like name and description, and list available assets with their sizes. It also includes a fallback mechanism in case the API structure changes."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook shows how to load basic information from an NWB file in the Dandiset very well. Cells 5-7 focus on selecting a specific NWB file (for subject F), constructing a download URL, loading the file using remfile and pynwb, and printing basic information about the file including session description, start time, subject ID, species, sex, and age. The code also includes a fallback mechanism if the desired file isn't found."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook successfully loads several independent pieces of data from the NWB file:\n1. OnePhotonSeries and ImagingPlane information in Cell 9 (excitation wavelength, location, indicator, etc.)\n2. ROI masks/cell footprints in Cell 11\n3. Fluorescence traces in Cell 14-15\n4. Event amplitude data in Cell 17-18\nThis qualifies as loading three or more independent pieces of data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook visualizes multiple types of data from the NWB file:\n1. ROI masks (individual and combined views) in Cell 12\n2. Normalized fluorescence traces for each ROI in Cell 15\n3. Event amplitude traces for each ROI in Cell 18\nThe notebook attempts to visualize a correlation matrix in Cell 20, but this fails due to insufficient variance in the ROIs.\nStill, this qualifies as visualizing three independent pieces of data from the NWB file."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "advanced-visualization",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "While the notebook creates some good visualizations, none of them would qualify as \"advanced visualizations involving multiple types of data.\" The notebook attempts to create a correlation matrix between ROIs in Cell 20, which could be considered an advanced visualization combining multiple datasets, but this fails to execute due to insufficient variance in the ROIs. The visualizations are effective but relatively straightforward, showing one type of data at a time."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The plots in the notebook are of reasonably good quality. The ROI mask visualizations in Cell 12 are well-constructed with appropriate colormaps, colorbars, and titles. The fluorescence and event amplitude trace plots in Cells 15 and 18 normalize the data, offset traces for visibility, include appropriate labels, legends, and grids. While not exceptional, the plots effectively communicate the data and are visually clear."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "There are no significant issues with the plots that are displayed. The notebook handles normalizing and displaying the data appropriately, including checks to avoid division by zero. All plots have proper labels, titles, and necessary visual elements. The only \"failure\" is the correlation matrix plot that doesn't display due to insufficient variance in the data, but this is properly explained and is a limitation of the data rather than a plotting issue."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "analysis-issues",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "There is one major analysis issue: the notebook is unable to compute correlations between ROIs because it cannot detect any ROIs with meaningful variance. This is noted in Cell 20 and suggested to be due to the small subset of data loaded from the archive or potentially a bug/artifact with the event amplitude data. Despite this limitation, the notebook acknowledges the issue rather than proceeding with invalid analysis. The issue is related to the data limitations rather than incorrect analysis methodology."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "The notebook generally avoids making unsupported conclusions. It sticks to describing what is observed in the data and acknowledges limitations, such as the small number of ROIs detected and the inability to compute correlations due to insufficient variance. The final cell accurately summarizes what was accomplished in the notebook, though it should have removed or reworded the fifth objective about ROI correlations since this analysis couldn't be completed. This is a minor issue."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "The main issue with the notebook is that one of its intended analyses (correlation between ROIs) cannot be completed due to data limitations or potential artifacts. However, the notebook handles this gracefully by explaining the issue rather than proceeding with invalid analysis. There's also a note that the final summary should have been updated to reflect that the correlation analysis couldn't be completed. These are minor issues that don't severely impact the notebook's overall quality or usefulness."
