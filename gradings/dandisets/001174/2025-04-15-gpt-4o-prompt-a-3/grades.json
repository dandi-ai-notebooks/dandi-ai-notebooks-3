    {
      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook provides a good description of the Dandiset in Cell 2, including its ID, title, description, license, keywords, and citation. It gives a reasonable overview of what the dataset contains (calcium imaging in SMA and M1 of macaques during motor tasks)."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook shows how to load information about the Dandiset using the DANDI API in Cell 7, retrieving the Dandiset by ID and listing its assets. It prints the total number of assets and the paths of the first five assets, which provides a reasonable demonstration of how to access the Dandiset information."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "Cell 9 demonstrates how to load an NWB file from a URL using remfile and h5py, then read it into a pynwb.NWBFile object. It also prints basic information like the session description and the number of acquisition data series, which provides a reasonable demonstration of loading basic NWB file information."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook only loads one piece of data from the NWB file - the OnePhotonSeries data in Cell 11. No other independent pieces of data are loaded from the NWB file."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook only visualizes one piece of data - the OnePhotonSeries data at a single timepoint using plt.imshow in Cell 11. No other independent pieces of data are visualized."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "advanced-visualization",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook does not create any advanced visualizations involving multiple types of data. It only shows a basic visualization of OnePhotonSeries data at a single timepoint."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The single plot in Cell 11 is of reasonably good quality. It has a title, labeled axes, and a colorbar that indicates the fluorescence intensity. While not exceptional, it is adequately formatted for understanding the data being displayed."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "There is a major issue with the plot in Cell 11: it only visualizes a single timepoint (index 0) which contradicts the stated purpose in the previous markdown cell to \"explore neuron activity patterns,\" which would require showing patterns over time. This is a significant limitation that makes the visualization much less useful for understanding the dynamic nature of the calcium imaging data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "analysis-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "The notebook doesn't attempt any substantial analysis beyond loading and basic visualization. The analysis is very minimal, but what it does, it does without major issues. The lack of temporal analysis for time-series data like calcium imaging could be considered a minor issue."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook doesn't draw any significant conclusions beyond describing what data is available and what it represents. The concluding cell simply summarizes what was done and suggests future directions. There are no unsupported conclusions."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "The notebook is quite minimal in scope. It only loads one file and visualizes one piece of data at a single timepoint. For a dataset with calcium imaging data across multiple brain regions during motor tasks, this barely scratches the surface. The notebook could be significantly improved by exploring more of the data, showing how neurons respond over time during different task conditions, or comparing data across different sessions or brain regions. However, these are more about missed opportunities than actual issues with what was done."
