    {
      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook provides a good description of the Dandiset in Cell 2, including its title, ID, a brief description of the dataset (calcium imaging in SMA and M1 of macaques during motor tasks), the license, keywords, and citation information. This gives a reasonably complete overview of the Dandiset."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "Cell 7 demonstrates using the dandiapi library to connect to the DANDI archive, retrieve Dandiset 001174, and list its assets. It shows the total number of assets and the paths of the first five assets. This is a reasonably good demonstration of loading information about the Dandiset."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "Cell 9 loads an NWB file from a specified URL using remfile and h5py, reads it into a pynwb.NWBFile object, and prints the session description and the number of acquisition data series. This demonstrates loading basic information from an NWB file in the Dandiset reasonably well."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook only loads one piece of data - the OnePhotonSeries data from the loaded NWB file in Cell 11. No other independent pieces of data are loaded from the NWB file."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook only visualizes one piece of data - the OnePhotonSeries data at a single timepoint in Cell 11. No other independent pieces of data are visualized from the NWB file."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "There is only one plot in the notebook (Cell 11), which visualizes the OnePhotonSeries data as a heatmap. The plot includes a title, axis labels, and a colorbar, which makes it reasonably good quality."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "The visualization in Cell 11 only shows a single arbitrary timepoint, which doesn't demonstrate neuron activity patterns over time as claimed in the markdown cell. A more helpful visualization would show either a mean fluorescence across time, a maximum projection, or allow selection of different timepoints. This is a major issue with the plot."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "analysis-issues",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook doesn't perform much analysis beyond loading and visualizing a single timepoint of data. While this is limited, it doesn't contain errors or issues in the analysis that is performed."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook doesn't draw any significant conclusions about the data. Cell 12 simply summarizes what was done and suggests future directions. There are no unsupported conclusions."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook is quite limited in scope, only loading and visualizing a single piece of data at a single timepoint. It doesn't fully demonstrate the potential of the dataset or provide a comprehensive exploration. However, what it does do appears to be implemented correctly without other major issues."
