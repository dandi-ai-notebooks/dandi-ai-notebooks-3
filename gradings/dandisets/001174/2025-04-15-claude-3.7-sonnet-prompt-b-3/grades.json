      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook provides a good description of the Dandiset, as seen in cells 1-2 and cell 10. It includes information about the experimental setup, brain regions (SMA and M1), technique (one-photon calcium imaging), and animal model (rhesus macaques). It also provides details from the metadata such as subject ID, species, sex, age, etc. This is a reasonably comprehensive description."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook demonstrates loading the Dandiset using the DANDI API in cells 5-6. It successfully connects to the DANDI archive, retrieves the Dandiset with ID \"001174\", and lists assets within the Dandiset. This is done reasonably well."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook shows how to load basic information from an NWB file in cells 8-10. It uses remfile to handle the remote file and h5py/pynwb to open and read the NWB data. It also demonstrates extracting metadata from the NWB file such as session description, subject ID, processing modules, etc. This is done well."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook demonstrates loading various types of data from the NWB file:\n1. OnePhotonSeries data (cells 11-13)\n2. ROI image masks (cells 16-19)\n3. Fluorescence data (cells 21-22)\n4. Event amplitude data (cells 27-28)\nThese constitute at least four independent pieces of data loaded from the NWB file."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook demonstrates visualizing multiple types of data from the NWB file:\n1. Raw fluorescence frame (cell 15)\n2. ROI masks (cell 19)\n3. Mean fluorescence by ROI (cell 24)\n4. Fluorescence traces (cell 26)\n5. Event amplitude traces (cell 28)\n6. Fluorescence activity heatmap (cell 31)\n7. Binary event raster plot (cell 33)\n8. Total population activity (cell 35)\n9. Simultaneously active neurons (cell 37)\n10. Correlation matrix (cell 39)\nThis is well beyond the requirement of three or more independent visualizations."

    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The plots shown in the notebook have good quality in terms of having appropriate labels, titles, colorbars when needed, and legends. The visualizations are diverse and appropriate for the data being shown. However, there are some minor issues with certain plots, such as overlapping x-axis labels and the final plot (cell 43) being empty. Overall, the quality is reasonably good but not perfect."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": -3,
      "thinking": "There are several issues with the plots:\n1. In cell 19, the ROI masks visualization is based on a critical misinterpretation of the data structure.\n2. In cell 24, the x-axis labels are not completely visible.\n3. In cell 31, the x-axis labels overlap and are difficult to read.\n4. In cell 43, the plot is completely empty, indicating a major issue with the code.\n\nHaving multiple issues including at least two major ones (the ROI mask misinterpretation and the empty plot) qualifies this for a score of -3."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "analysis-issues",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "There are several analysis issues in the notebook:\n1. The critical misinterpretation of the 'image_mask' data in cell 19, where the notebook treats it as a full image rather than coordinates and weights.\n2. The calculation of statistics and visualizations using only small samples of the data (1000 timepoints) without sufficient explanation of the limitations.\n3. The selection of top ROIs in cell 43 appears to be incorrect, resulting in an empty plot.\n4. The ROI selection in cell 43 is inconsistent with previous analysis (the top ROIs identified don't match the active ones seen in previous visualizations).\n\nThese constitute at least two major analysis issues."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "There are some unsupported conclusions in the summary (cell 44):\n1. The claim about \"little or no coordinated activity\" is not well supported, as the correlation matrix shows some moderate correlations, and the global firing rate plot shows simultaneous firing.\n2. The conclusions are drawn from limited time samples rather than the full dataset, but this limitation isn't mentioned.\n\nThese are relatively minor unsupported conclusions rather than major ones."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "Other issues include:\n1. Inconsistency in time representation across plots (some use sample indices, others use seconds).\n2. The markdown text doesn't always clearly state the limitations of the analysis, particularly regarding the sampling of data.\n3. The summary doesn't acknowledge the errors and limitations in the notebook.\n\nThese are relatively minor issues rather than major ones."
