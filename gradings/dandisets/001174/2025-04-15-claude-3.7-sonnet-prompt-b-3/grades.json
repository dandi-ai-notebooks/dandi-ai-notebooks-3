    {
      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook provides a good description of the Dandiset in cells 1 and 2. It clearly identifies the Dandiset (001174), the type of data (calcium imaging in SMA and M1 of macaques), the experimental setup, and the techniques used (one-photon calcium imaging with miniature microscopes). The description is reasonably detailed and provides context for the analysis."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook effectively shows how to load the Dandiset in cells 5-6. It uses the dandi.dandiapi library to connect to the DANDI archive, retrieve the Dandiset, and list the assets. It also demonstrates how to select a specific NWB file for further exploration."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook shows how to load basic information from an NWB file in cells 8-10. It uses remfile, h5py, and pynwb to open and read the NWB data, then extracts and prints various metadata including session description, subject information, and available data types."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook demonstrates loading multiple types of data from the NWB file:\n1. OnePhotonSeries data (cells 11-12)\n2. ROI image masks (cells 16-19)\n3. Fluorescence signals (cells 21-22)\n4. Event amplitude data (cells 27-28)\nThis covers at least three independent pieces of data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook visualizes multiple types of data:\n1. Sample frame from the calcium imaging (cell 15)\n2. ROI masks (cell 19)\n3. Fluorescence traces (cell 26)\n4. Event amplitude traces (cell 28)\n5. Fluorescence heatmap (cell 31)\n6. Binary event raster plot (cell 33)\n7. Total population activity (cell 35)\n8. Number of active neurons (cell 37)\n9. Correlation matrix (cell 39)\nThis covers well more than three independent pieces of data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "advanced-visualization",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook creates several advanced visualizations:\n- The ROI fluorescence heatmap in cell 31 combines data from all ROIs over time\n- The binary event raster plot in cell 33 shows events across all ROIs\n- The correlation matrix in cell 39 shows relationships between all ROIs\nThese visualizations effectively combine multiple types of data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The plots in the notebook are generally of good quality, with appropriate axis labels, titles, and color schemes. The heatmap and correlation matrix are particularly well done. However, there are some issues, such as overlapping axis labels in some plots and an empty plot in cell 43. Overall, the quality is reasonable but not excellent."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": -3,
      "thinking": "There are several issues with the plots:\n- Major issue: The interpretation of ROI masks in cells 19-20 is fundamentally incorrect, leading to misleading visualizations\n- Major issue: The plot in cell 43 is empty, indicating a problem with the code or data selection\n- Minor issue: Overlapping axis labels in the heatmap (cell 31)\n- Minor issue: Some plots use \"Time Sample Index\" while others use \"Time (seconds)\"\nThese include at least two major issues."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "analysis-issues",
      "grade": -3,
      "thinking": "There are several issues with the analysis:\n- Major issue: The misinterpretation of the 'image_mask' data structure in cells 19-20, which fundamentally misunderstands what the data represents\n- Major issue: The selection of top ROIs in cell 43 appears to be incorrect, as it produces an empty plot\n- Minor issue: Many analyses use only a sample of 1000 timepoints, which may not be representative, and this limitation is not clearly stated\n- Minor issue: Correlations are computed on a limited sample without acknowledging this limitation\nThese include at least two major issues."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "The notebook contains some unsupported conclusions:\n- Minor issue: The claim that there is \"little or no coordinated activity between ROIs\" in the summary (cell 44) contradicts the correlation matrix, which shows some moderate correlations\n- Minor issue: The description of ROI masks in cell 20 is inaccurate due to the misinterpretation of the data structure\nWhile there are inaccuracies, I don't see major unsupported conclusions that go far beyond what the data would support."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "There are a few additional issues:\n- The sampling issue persists throughout much of the analysis, with only 1000 timepoints being used, which may not be representative of the entire dataset\n- The final plot (cell 43) fails to display any data, which is a significant flaw in the notebook's progression\n- The notebook does not explicitly state the relationship between fluorescence signals and event amplitude data\nThese are mostly minor issues, with one major issue (the empty plot)."
