    {
      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook provides a good description of the Dandiset (001375) in Cell 3, including the title, a brief description of the study, and the Dandiset URL. Cell 6 also retrieves and displays metadata about the Dandiset, including contributors. While the description is clear and informative, it could potentially provide more detail about the scientific context and significance of the study."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "Cell 6 shows how to connect to the DANDI archive, retrieve metadata about the Dandiset, and list the assets within it. The code retrieves and displays the Dandiset name, description, contributors, URL, and lists the names and sizes of the assets. This demonstrates loading information about the Dandiset very well."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "Cell 8 demonstrates loading an NWB file from the DANDI archive and accessing basic information from it, including session description, identifier, session start time, and file creation date. Cells 10, 12, and 19 show how to extract subject information, electrode group information, and unit information from the NWB file. The notebook does a thorough job of showing how to load and access basic information from the NWB file."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook demonstrates loading multiple independent pieces of data from the NWB file: 1) raw electrophysiology data in Cell 14, 2) trial information in Cell 16, and 3) spike times for neural units in Cells 19 and 21. Additionally, it calculates firing rates in Cell 23 and combines neural activity with trial data in Cell 25. This shows at least three independent pieces of data being loaded successfully."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook visualizes multiple types of data from the NWB file: 1) raw electrophysiology signals in Cell 14, 2) trial durations in Cell 16, 3) spike raster plots in Cell 21, 4) average firing rates in Cell 23, and 5) firing rates vs. trial data in Cell 25. This demonstrates visualizing at least three independent pieces of data from the NWB file."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "advanced-visualization",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "Cell 27 creates an advanced visualization that combines multiple units' spiking activity across multiple trials, with trial boundaries marked and timestamps normalized to trial start times. This is an effective advanced visualization that integrates neural activity data (spikes) with behavioral data (trials), showing their relationship."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The plots in the notebook appear to be of good quality. They have clear titles, appropriate axis labels, legends where necessary, and helpful visualizations of the data. Cell 14 shows raw electrophysiological data with offset channels for clarity, Cell 16 visualizes trial durations, Cell 21 shows a spike raster, Cell 23 displays average firing rates, Cell 25 combines multiple visualizations of neural activity and behavior, and Cell 27 creates an advanced multi-trial, multi-unit visualization. The plots effectively communicate the data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "Based on the critique, there don't appear to be any significant issues with the plots. No specific problems with axes, labels, scales, or visual presentation were mentioned. The plots seem to effectively visualize the data and include necessary components like titles, labels, and legends where appropriate."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "analysis-issues",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The only minor issue mentioned is in Cell 8, where the asset ID is hardcoded rather than programmatically determined, which could reduce reusability. However, this is a minor implementation detail rather than an analysis issue. No problems with the actual data analysis methodology, calculations, or interpretations were mentioned in the critique."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook appears to be cautious in drawing conclusions. Cell 17 provides a brief interpretation of the plot from Cell 16, stating that it shows how the animal's behavior varied, which is a reasonable and supported statement. Cell 28 summarizes the findings and suggests directions for future analysis without making unsupported claims. There don't seem to be any unsupported conclusions in the notebook."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "The only issue mentioned is in Cell 8, where the asset ID is hardcoded. While this could make the notebook less reusable, it's a minor implementation detail rather than a significant issue affecting the notebook's functionality or educational value. Cell 2 includes a disclaimer that the notebook was AI-generated and not fully verified, which is an appropriate acknowledgment of potential limitations."
