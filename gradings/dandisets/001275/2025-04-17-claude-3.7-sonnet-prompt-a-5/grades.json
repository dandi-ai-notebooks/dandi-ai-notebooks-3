      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook provides a good description of the Dandiset in Cell 3, explaining that it concerns mental navigation in primates, specifically in the posterior parietal cortex. It includes links to the original publication and Neurosift, and outlines the steps the notebook will cover. The description is reasonably detailed, though it could potentially provide more context about the experiment design and significance."
    },

      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook effectively demonstrates how to load the Dandiset information. Cell 7 shows how to connect to the DANDI archive using DandiAPIClient, retrieve the Dandiset with ID \"001275\", and list the assets within it. It prints the number of assets found and displays the paths of the first five assets, demonstrating a clear approach to accessing the dataset programmatically."

    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook shows how to load basic information from an NWB file in Cells 9-10. Cell 9 defines a URL for a specific NWB file, uses remfile and h5py to access it remotely, and pynwb to load it into an nwb object. Cell 10 then extracts and prints metadata from this file, including the file identifier, subject ID, species, session ID, start time, lab, institution, and session description. This provides a comprehensive overview of the experimental setup and data content."

      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook demonstrates loading multiple pieces of data from the NWB file:\n1. Trial information (Cell 12) - extracts trial data into a DataFrame\n2. Eye position data (Cell 16) - extracts eye position data from the behavior module\n3. Hand position data (Cell 19) - extracts hand position from the behavior module \n4. Unit/neuron information (Cell 22) - extracts unit information from the ecephys module\n5. Spike times for a specific unit (Cell 28) - extracts spike times for analysis\n6. Electrode information (Cell 37) - retrieves electrode data into a DataFrame\n\nThis shows loading of more than three independent pieces of data from the NWB file."

      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook provides multiple visualizations of different data types:\n1. Trial outcomes as pie charts (Cell 14) - shows success rates and trial validity\n2. Eye position data as time series plots and heatmaps (Cells 17-18)\n3. Hand position data as time series and histogram (Cell 20)\n4. Unit quality distribution as bar plot (Cell 23) \n5. Firing rate distribution as histogram (Cell 24)\n6. Spike count distribution as histogram (Cell 25)\n7. Spike timing as raster plot (Cell 28)\n8. Neural activity around go cue as PSTH (Cell 29)\n9. Neural activity by trial type and outcome (Cells 31-32)\n10. Electrode positions as scatter plot (Cell 38)\n\nThis shows visualization of more than three independent pieces of data from the NWB file."

      "question_id": "advanced-visualization",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook creates several advanced visualizations that combine multiple types of data:\n1. Cells 31 and 32 combine neural spiking data with trial type/outcome data to show how neural activity differs across conditions\n2. Cell 35 correlates neural firing rates with behavioral response times\n3. Cell 40 shows the relationship between actual and produced time vectors across trial types\n4. Cell 42 examines the relationship between delay and response time grouped by trial type\n\nThese visualizations effectively integrate neural and behavioral data to explore relationships between them, which is a hallmark of advanced visualization in neuroscience."

    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The plots in the notebook are generally of good quality. They have appropriate titles, axis labels, and use suitable visualization types for the data being represented. The notebook uses seaborn styling for visual appeal, and employs a variety of plot types (pie charts, line plots, scatter plots, histograms, bar plots, etc.) appropriately for different data types. However, there are some issues with empty plots (Cell 41) and plots showing potentially problematic data values (extremely high response times in Cells 40 and 42), which prevent the plots from being rated as \"very good quality\"."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "There are several issues with the plots in the notebook:\n1. In Cell 31, the graphs for Trial Types 1 and 2 are blank because there are no trials for these types, but this isn't explicitly explained in the notebook\n2. Cell 41 produces a completely empty violin plot with no data\n3. In Cell 40, the y-axis values reach extremely high values (~100 seconds) which seem implausible for response times in a mental navigation task\n4. In Cell 42, most response time values are close to zero with some outliers at 400-500 seconds, suggesting potential data issues\n5. Also in Cell 42, the x-axis values for delay are on the scale of 10^6 seconds (equivalent to 11 days), which seems unrealistic\n\nThese represent at least two major issues related to potentially incorrect data visualization without appropriate explanation or correction."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "analysis-issues",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "There are some analysis issues in the notebook:\n1. In Cell 19, there's a potential mismatch between the expected dimensions of the hand_positions array (should be 2D but might be 1D)\n2. In Cell 35 and subsequent cells, there appears to be a problem with the reaction time/response time data, as some values are unrealistically high (400+ seconds)\n3. The notebook doesn't adequately address the potential issues with the response time data in Cells 40-42\n4. The delay values in Cell 42 are on the order of 10^6 seconds (11+ days), which seems implausible and suggests a units or scaling issue\n\nThese represent at least one major issue (the problematic response time/delay data) that affects multiple analyses in the notebook."

    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook is generally cautious about drawing conclusions. The summary in Cell 43 presents findings as observations rather than strong claims. There are no major unsupported conclusions drawn from the data. The notebook acknowledges in Cell 2 that it was automatically generated and has not been fully verified, advising caution when interpreting results. When correlations are calculated (like in Cell 35), the values are reported without overinterpreting them."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "There are a few minor issues with the notebook:\n1. The notebook doesn't adequately explain why there are no trials for Trial Types 1 and 2 when this becomes apparent in Cell 31\n2. In Cell 34, the analysis randomly limits the number of considered trials to 200 for performance reasons, which could affect the representativeness of the results, but this limitation isn't thoroughly discussed\n3. The notebook could benefit from more contextual explanations about the experimental paradigm and what the different trial types and measures represent\n\nThese are relatively minor issues that don't significantly impair the overall functionality of the notebook."
