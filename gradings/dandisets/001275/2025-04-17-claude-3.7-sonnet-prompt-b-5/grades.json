    {
      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook does an excellent job describing the Dandiset. Cells 3, 8, and 13 provide comprehensive information about the dataset, including that it contains neural recordings from two macaques during a mental navigation task, focuses on neural mechanisms of spatial representation in the posterior parietal cortex, and provides details about the specific tasks performed by the subjects. The description is thorough and provides the necessary context for understanding the data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "Cells 6-8 demonstrate how to load the Dandiset effectively. The notebook uses the DANDI API to connect to the DANDI archive, retrieve the specified Dandiset (001275), and list the available assets. It also explains the structure of the assets, identifying the subjects and types of files available. This provides a clear and comprehensive demonstration of loading Dandiset information."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "Cells 9-12 demonstrate loading basic information from an NWB file quite well. The notebook selects a specific NWB file (behavior+ecephys.nwb from subject \"Amadeus\"), constructs the download URL, uses remfile and h5py to stream the file, and opens it with pynwb. It then extracts and displays metadata attributes including session ID, subject ID, species, sex, age, session date, session description, lab, and institution. This provides a thorough demonstration of loading and accessing basic NWB file information."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook loads multiple independent pieces of data from the NWB file. These include:\n1. Trial information (cell 15) - loaded and converted to a pandas DataFrame\n2. Unit data (cell 37) - retrieved and converted to a DataFrame\n3. Electrode information (cell 47) - retrieved and converted to a DataFrame\nThe notebook effectively demonstrates loading these different types of data from the NWB file."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook visualizes multiple independent pieces of data:\n1. Distribution of trial types (cell 17) - bar chart\n2. Success rate by trial type (cell 19) - bar plot\n3. Distribution of response times (cell 22) - histogram for different trial types\n4. Response time distributions by trial success (cell 25) - histogram\n5. Actual vector vs produced vector (cell 28) - scatter plot\n6. Distribution of absolute error (cell 31) - histogram\n7. Heatmap of start and target landmark combinations (cell 34)\n8. Distribution of unit qualities (cell 39) - bar plot\n9. Distribution of firing rates (cell 42) - histogram\n10. Firing rate distributions by unit quality (cell 44) - histogram\n11. Firing rate vs electrode depth (cell 49) - scatter plot\n12. Simulated firing rates in successful vs failure trials (cell 53) - scatter plot\nThe notebook demonstrates extensive visualization of different aspects of the data."

    {
      "question_id": "advanced-visualization",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook includes several visualizations that combine multiple types of data. Cell 28 creates a scatter plot comparing the actual vector against the produced vector, color-coded by trial type. Cell 34 produces a heatmap showing the number of trials for each combination of start and target landmarks. Cell 49 creates a scatter plot showing the relationship between firing rate and electrode depth, separated by unit quality. These visualizations effectively combine and relate different aspects of the data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The plots in the notebook are generally of high quality. They have clear titles, appropriate axis labels, and use color coding effectively to distinguish different categories (e.g., trial types, unit qualities). The histograms, bar charts, scatter plots, and heatmap are all well-executed and informative. The notebook also limits the ranges of some plots (e.g., response times limited to 0-2 seconds) to focus on the most relevant data. The plots effectively convey the patterns and relationships in the data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "There are some minor issues with the plots:\n1. In cell 28, the scatter plot of actual vector vs produced vector shows vertical bands of data points that are not explained in the notebook.\n2. In cell 53, the scatter plot is based on simulated data rather than actual aligned spike times, which limits its interpretability (though this limitation is clearly acknowledged).\nThese are relatively minor issues that don't significantly detract from the overall quality of the visualization."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "analysis-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "There are some minor issues with the analysis:\n1. In cell 28, the filtering of produced vector tp with \"reasonable_tp_mask = trials_df['tp'].abs() < 10\" appears somewhat arbitrary and is not justified.\n2. In cell 31, the code generates a SettingWithCopyWarning when creating the error and abs_error columns, which could be addressed using .loc.\n3. In cell 53, the analysis uses simulated data rather than actual aligned spike times (though this limitation is clearly acknowledged).\nThese are minor issues that don't significantly impact the overall quality of the analysis."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "The notebook mostly draws well-supported conclusions, with one exception:\nCell 50 suggests that \"good\" units tend to have higher firing rates, particularly at intermediate depths, which is not well supported by the scatter plot in cell 49. The small number of points and their scattered nature make it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the relationship between depth and firing rate.\nThis is a minor unsupported conclusion that doesn't significantly detract from the overall quality of the notebook."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "There are no other significant issues with the notebook. The notebook includes a warning in cell 10 about namespace version conflicts, but this appears to be related to the pynwb installation rather than an issue with the notebook itself. The notebook also acknowledges its limitations, particularly regarding the use of simulated data for the neural-behavioral relationship analysis. Overall, the notebook is well-structured, clear, and accomplishes its goals of introducing the reader to the Dandiset and demonstrating how to load, visualize, and begin analyzing the data."
