    {
      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook provides only a brief description of the Dandiset in the first cell, mentioning it contains LFP data related to \"Control of Working Memory by Phase-Amplitude Coupling.\" However, there is a critical issue where the notebook mentions Dandiset 000673 in the introduction but then uses ID 001174 in the actual code. This inconsistency severely undermines the description of the Dandiset. Additionally, there's no detailed explanation of the dataset's contents, experimental design, or relevance."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook attempts to load the Dandiset in Cell 3, but uses an incorrect Dandiset ID (001174 instead of 000673). This is a critical error that prevents the notebook from correctly showing how to load the intended Dandiset. While the code itself might technically work for loading a Dandiset, it's loading the wrong one, which constitutes a severe problem."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "In Cell 5, the notebook loads an NWB file using a hardcoded URL rather than selecting it from the Dandiset assets. The code does successfully load the NWB file and display its metadata, but there's a disconnect because the file isn't properly sourced from the Dandiset mentioned in the introduction. Additionally, there's a warning about potential transposition issues with the data that isn't addressed."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook only loads one piece of data from the NWB file - the LFP data in Cell 7. It doesn't load any other independent pieces of data like event timeseries, trial information, or unit data that were mentioned in the metadata. Additionally, the loading is very limited (only taking 10 samples from 10 channels) without justification."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook only visualizes one piece of data - the LFP signals in Cell 8. It doesn't visualize any other independent pieces of data. The visualization is also quite limited, showing only 10 data points for 10 channels, which isn't enough to gain meaningful insights."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "advanced-visualization",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook does not create any advanced visualizations involving multiple types of data. It only shows a basic line plot of LFP signals from 10 channels, and even that is limited to just 10 data points per channel."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The plot shown in Cell 8 has basic elements like a title, axis labels, and a legend, but it has significant issues. The x-axis uses sample indices instead of time, the y-axis label might be incorrect (using \"Voltage (V)\" when the data might not be converted from ADC units), and the plot only shows an extremely limited amount of data (10 points per channel) which is too little to be informative."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": -3,
      "thinking": "The plot has multiple major issues: 1) Using sample indices instead of time on the x-axis, 2) Potentially incorrect y-axis label (Voltage (V)), and 3) Showing only 10 data points per channel, which is too limited to provide any meaningful visualization of the LFP signals. These issues significantly reduce the plot's usefulness and interpretability."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "analysis-issues",
      "grade": -3,
      "thinking": "The notebook has major analysis issues: 1) It uses the wrong Dandiset ID, analyzing a completely different dataset than the one mentioned in the introduction, 2) It arbitrarily selects a tiny subset of data (10 samples from 10 channels) without justification, providing extremely limited analysis, and 3) It doesn't account for sampling rate when visualizing time series data. These are fundamental flaws in the analysis approach."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "The conclusion in Cell 9 mentions visualizing \"LFP signal variability across channels\" and suggests future analyses, but this is an overstatement given the extremely limited data shown (only 10 data points per channel). The notebook doesn't show enough data to support even basic conclusions about LFP signal variability. Additionally, suggesting further analyses without addressing the fundamental issue of using the wrong Dandiset is problematic."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": -3,
      "thinking": "There are two major issues: 1) The fundamental mismatch between the Dandiset ID mentioned in the introduction (000673) and the one used in the code (001174), which means the entire notebook is analyzing the wrong dataset, and 2) The hardcoding of a URL to access an NWB file rather than properly selecting it from the Dandiset's assets. These issues severely impact the notebook's validity and reproducibility."
