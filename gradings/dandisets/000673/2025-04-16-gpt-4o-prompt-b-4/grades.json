    {
      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook provides some basic description of the Dandiset in Cell 1, mentioning it's about local field potential (LFP) data from \"Control of Working Memory by Phase-Amplitude Coupling\" and noting its open-access status and licensing. However, there's a critical inconsistency where Cell 1 mentions Dandiset 000673 but Cell 3 retrieves Dandiset 001174. This major discrepancy means the description doesn't effectively match the data being analyzed."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook attempts to load the Dandiset in Cell 3, but uses the wrong Dandiset ID (001174 instead of 000673). This is a critical error that means the wrong dataset is being loaded. While the code structure for loading is reasonable, this fundamental error significantly reduces its effectiveness."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "Cell 5 loads an NWB file using a hardcoded URL rather than selecting from the Dandiset assets. This approach works but is inflexible. The metadata is displayed, providing information about the NWB file's contents. However, there's a warning about dimension mismatch for the LFPs, and the connection to the previously loaded Dandiset is unclear due to the hardcoded URL."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook loads only one piece of data - LFP data in Cell 7. This loading is done poorly, as it only takes a very small subset of the data (10 samples from 10 channels) without justification, and doesn't retrieve important metadata like the sampling rate."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "Cell 8 visualizes only one type of data (LFP signals). The visualization has several issues: it uses sample indices instead of time, the voltage labels may be misleading, and it only shows 10 data points which is inadequate for meaningful analysis."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "advanced-visualization",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook does not create any advanced visualizations involving multiple types of data. The only visualization is a basic time series plot of LFP signals from different channels, which does not qualify as an advanced visualization."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The single plot in Cell 8 has several significant quality issues: it uses sample indices instead of time, potentially has incorrect y-axis labels (Voltage (V)), and only shows an extremely limited sample of data (10 points). These issues significantly reduce the informative value of the plot."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "There are several major issues with the plot: 1) Missing time information - x-axis shows sample indices instead of time, 2) Potentially misleading y-axis label for voltage, 3) Extremely limited data sampling (only 10 points) that doesn't provide meaningful insight."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-redundancy",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "There is only one plot in the notebook, so there is no redundancy between plots."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook makes only general statements about visualizing LFP signal variability in Cell 9 and doesn't make specific claims about the data that could be considered unsupported conclusions. The conclusions are minimal and general enough to not be problematic."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "There are two major issues affecting the entire notebook: 1) The wrong Dandiset ID is used (001174 instead of 000673), meaning the entire analysis is performed on the wrong dataset, 2) The analysis uses a hardcoded URL to access an NWB file rather than selecting from the Dandiset assets, which makes the notebook less flexible and doesn't demonstrate proper Dandiset usage."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "overall-effectiveness",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "The notebook has significant fundamental flaws that severely limit its effectiveness. It uses the wrong Dandiset ID, uses a hardcoded URL rather than proper Dandiset asset selection, visualizes an extremely limited sample of data (10 points), and has plot labeling issues. These problems would make it difficult for a user to effectively get started with loading, visualizing, and analyzing this Dandiset. The notebook demonstrates basic mechanics of accessing NWB files but fails in its primary purpose of introducing the specific Dandiset mentioned."
