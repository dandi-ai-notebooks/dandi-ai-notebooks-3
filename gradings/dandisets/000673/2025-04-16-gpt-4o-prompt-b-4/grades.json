      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook provides a brief description of the Dandiset in Cell 1, mentioning it's about \"Control of Working Memory by Phase-Amplitude Coupling\" and provides some basic information about the data and licensing. However, there's a critical issue with the Dandiset ID inconsistency (Cell 3 uses 001174 instead of 000673 mentioned in Cell 1), which indicates poor description and handling of the Dandiset information."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook attempts to load the Dandiset in Cell 3, but uses an incorrect Dandiset ID. This is a critical error that results in loading the wrong dataset entirely. While the code structure for loading might be reasonable, using the wrong ID means the notebook fails at its most basic task."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "Cell 5 loads an NWB file using a hardcoded URL rather than selecting it properly from the Dandiset. While the code does successfully load an NWB file and display its metadata, the approach lacks context on why this specific file was chosen, and there's a warning about potential issues with the data's orientation. The loading process itself works but with significant methodological issues."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook only loads one piece of data - LFP signals from the NWB file in Cell 7. It doesn't explore other data types that might be in the file, despite the metadata suggesting there are multiple types of data available (events, timestamps, etc.). The extraction is also quite limited, only taking 10 samples from 10 channels without justification."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook only visualizes one piece of data - the LFP signals in Cell 8. No other visualizations are presented despite the richness of the data mentioned in the metadata. The visualization is also quite limited, showing only 10 data points which is insufficient for meaningful analysis."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The quality of the plot is poor. While it does include labels for axes and a title, it has several significant issues: it uses sample index instead of time on the x-axis, the y-axis potentially has incorrect units (labeled as Voltage when it might be ADC counts), and it only shows 10 data points which is too limited for meaningful visualization of neural data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": -3,
      "thinking": "There are multiple major issues with the plot: (1) it uses sample indices instead of time on the x-axis, making temporal interpretation impossible; (2) it potentially mislabels the y-axis units; and (3) it only visualizes 10 data points, which is far too few for meaningful interpretation of neural data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "analysis-issues",
      "grade": -3,
      "thinking": "There are multiple major issues with the analysis: (1) the notebook analyzes the wrong dataset due to the Dandiset ID mismatch; (2) there's arbitrary subsetting of data without justification; (3) the analysis doesn't account for the sampling rate; (4) the analysis is extremely limited in scope, only looking at 10 samples which is insufficient for any meaningful conclusion about neural signals."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "The notebook's conclusion in Cell 9 suggests it has demonstrated \"LFP signal variability across channels\" but this conclusion is not well-supported given the extremely limited analysis of only 10 data points. The summary also suggests potential for further analyses without acknowledging the fundamental flaw of analyzing the wrong dataset."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": -3,
      "thinking": "The most critical issue is that the notebook uses the wrong Dandiset ID (001174 instead of 000673), meaning the entire analysis is performed on the wrong dataset. Additionally, the use of hardcoded URLs rather than properly selecting assets from the Dandiset makes the notebook less reproducible and harder to understand."
