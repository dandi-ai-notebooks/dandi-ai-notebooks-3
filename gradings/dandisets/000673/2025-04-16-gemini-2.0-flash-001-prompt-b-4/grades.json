    {
      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook introduces Dandiset 000673 and provides a clear description of its content and purpose. Cells 1-4 provide context about the Dandiset, including its title, a link to view it on Neurosift, and a general overview of the experiment. The description is quite thorough and helps the reader understand what the data is about."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "Cell 6 shows how to use the dandiapi library to connect to the DANDI archive, retrieve metadata for Dandiset 000673, and list the first five assets (NWB files). This demonstrates good practices for loading Dandiset information."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "Cell 8 shows how to load a specific NWB file using pynwb, h5py, and remfile. It prints basic metadata like session_description, identifier, and session_start_time. This demonstrates effective loading of basic NWB file information."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook loads two independent pieces of data: 1) LFP data in cell 10, and 2) stimulus template images in cell 12. Both data types are successfully loaded and prepared for visualization."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook visualizes two independent pieces of data: 1) LFP data using histograms in cell 10, and 2) stimulus template images in a grid in cell 12. Both visualizations effectively show the characteristics of the loaded data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The plots are functional but have some issues. The LFP histograms have overlapping y-axis labels, which affects readability. The stimulus images are displayed clearly but are shown as rotated at various angles without explanation. Overall, the plots are reasonably good but have room for improvement."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "There is one notable issue with the plots: the y-axis labels in the LFP histograms are overlapping with the subplots, which could be fixed by adjusting layout parameters. This is a minor issue affecting readability but not completely undermining the visualization."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "analysis-issues",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "There is one major issue with the analysis: the warning about potentially transposed data for the LFP ElectricalSeries is ignored. This could significantly impact the interpretation of the LFP data visualizations and any conclusions drawn from them. The notebook should have addressed this warning or at least acknowledged its potential impact."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook does not appear to draw unsupported conclusions. Cell 13 mentions potential directions for future analysis but does not make claims about findings. The notebook appropriately frames itself as an introductory exploration rather than making scientific claims."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "No other major issues are apparent from the critique. The notebook includes appropriate disclaimers about being AI-generated, has clear structure with good transitions between sections, and outlines potential next steps for analysis."
