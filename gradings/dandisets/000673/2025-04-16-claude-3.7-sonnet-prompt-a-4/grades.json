    {
      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook provides a detailed description of Dandiset 000673 in Cell 3, including information about the content, experimental setup (working memory task), key findings, and links to additional resources like Neurosift and code repositories. Cell 9 also describes the specific NWB file being analyzed. Overall, the description is thorough and informative."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "Cell 8 demonstrates how to connect to the DANDI archive, retrieve the specified Dandiset (000673), and list its assets. It also prints basic information about the Dandiset including ID, name, number of assets, and details about the first 5 assets. This provides a clear demonstration of loading the Dandiset information."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "Cell 10 shows how to load a specific NWB file from the Dandiset using its asset ID and the remfile library. It then extracts and prints key metadata from the file such as identifier, session description, subject information, institution, and lab. Cells 12, 14, and 16 further demonstrate how to access specific information like experiment description, electrode information, and trial information within the NWB file. This thoroughly demonstrates loading and accessing basic information from an NWB file."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook demonstrates loading multiple independent pieces of data from the NWB file:\n1. Electrode information (Cell 14)\n2. Trial information (Cell 16)\n3. LFP data (Cell 22)\n4. Unit/spike data (Cell 28)\n5. Stimulus templates/images (Cell 34)\n6. Stimulus presentation information (Cell 36)\nThis is more than three independent pieces of data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook visualizes multiple independent pieces of data:\n1. Behavioral performance by memory load (Cell 18)\n2. Trial timeline visualization (Cell 20)\n3. LFP signal during a trial (Cell 24)\n4. LFP spectrogram (Cell 26)\n5. Distribution of unit isolation distances (Cell 28)\n6. Spike times for a single unit (Cell 30)\n7. Spike activity during maintenance period by memory load (Cell 32)\n8. Sample stimulus images (Cell 34)\n9. Timeline of stimulus presentations (Cell 38)\nThis is well more than three independent visualizations."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The plots in the notebook are of very good quality. They include proper titles, axis labels, legends where appropriate, and annotations. The trial timeline visualization, LFP signal plot with event markers, spectrogram, and spike raster plots are all well-designed and informative. The plots effectively communicate the data and analyses."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "There is only one minor issue with the plots: In Cell 32, the \"Load 2 Trials\" subplot is completely empty, suggesting an issue in the data or code that prevents spikes (or trials) from being analyzed for load 2. This should be investigated but is not a major issue with the overall visualization approach."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "analysis-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "There is one minor issue with the analysis in Cell 36, where the \"image_id\" column in the output DataFrame displays the raw RGB pixel data for each image instead of the actual image ID string. The code attempts to map the image index to image IDs from the stimulus templates, but it doesn't work as expected. This is a minor implementation issue that doesn't significantly impact the overall analysis."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "Based on the critique, the notebook does not appear to draw any unsupported conclusions. The analyses are presented as explorations of the data, and Cell 39 appropriately summarizes the analyses performed and suggests potential future research directions without overreaching."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "There are no other significant issues mentioned in the critique. The notebook appears to be well-structured, with clear explanations before code cells, appropriate transitions between analyses, and a coherent flow from basic data exploration to more complex analyses."
