    {
      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook does an excellent job describing the Dandiset. Cell 3 provides a detailed overview of Dandiset 000673, including the content, experimental setup (working memory task), key findings, and links to Neurosift and a public code repository. The description is informative and helps users understand the context and potential value of the data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook demonstrates loading the Dandiset effectively. Cell 7 introduces the process, and Cell 8 shows the code to connect to the DANDI archive, retrieve the specified Dandiset (000673), list its assets, and display basic information about the Dandiset (ID, name, number of assets, and paths/sizes of the first 5 assets)."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook shows how to load basic information from an NWB file very well. Cell 10 loads a specific NWB file from the Dandiset using its asset ID and extracts key metadata, such as file identifier, session description, subject information, institution, and lab. Cell 12 displays the experiment description, Cell 14 extracts electrode information, and Cell 16 loads trial information."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook demonstrates loading multiple types of data from the NWB file:\n1. Trial data (Cell 16) - loads trial information into a DataFrame\n2. LFP data (Cell 22) - loads LFP data and electrode information\n3. Spike data (Cell 28-30) - loads unit information and spike times\n4. Stimulus templates (Cell 34) - loads stimulus images\n5. Stimulus presentation data (Cell 36) - loads stimulus presentation information\n\nThis covers more than three independent pieces of data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook shows visualization of multiple types of data:\n1. Behavioral data - accuracy by memory load (Cell 18)\n2. Trial timeline visualization (Cell 20)\n3. LFP data from hippocampus (Cell 24)\n4. Spectrogram of hippocampal LFP (Cell 26)\n5. Spike data unit isolation distance histogram (Cell 28)\n6. Spike times raster plot (Cell 30)\n7. Spike activity by memory load (Cell 32)\n8. Stimulus images display (Cell 34)\n9. Stimulus presentation timeline (Cell 38)\n\nThis covers more than three independent visualizations."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "advanced-visualization",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook includes several advanced visualizations that combine multiple data types:\n1. In Cell 24, LFP data is visualized with overlay of trial event timings\n2. Cell 26 shows a spectrogram of hippocampal LFP with trial events overlaid\n3. Cell 30 combines spike times with trial event timings\n4. Cell 32 creates a complex visualization comparing spike activity across different memory loads\n\nThese visualizations effectively combine temporal, neural, and behavioral data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The plots in the notebook are of very good quality. They include appropriate titles, axis labels, legends, and annotations. The plots are clear, informative, and well-designed. The trial timeline visualization (Cell 20), LFP visualization (Cell 24), spectrogram (Cell 26), and spike raster plots (Cell 30, Cell 32) are particularly well-executed with clear marking of trial events and good visual design."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "There is one minor issue with the plots: In Cell 32, the \"Load 2 Trials\" subplot is completely empty, suggesting an issue in the data or code that prevents spikes (or trials) from being analyzed for load 2. This should be investigated but doesn't severely impact the overall quality of the notebook."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "analysis-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "One minor issue was identified in Cell 36, where the \"image_id\" column in the output DataFrame displays the raw RGB pixel data for each image instead of the actual image ID string. The code attempts to map the image index to image IDs from the stimulus templates, but it doesn't work as expected. This is a minor issue that doesn't significantly impact the analysis."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "Based on the critique, there are no unsupported conclusions drawn in the notebook. The notebook appropriately focuses on data exploration and visualization without making unjustified claims about the data or results."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "No other issues were identified in the notebook critique. The notebook appears to be well-structured, with clear explanations, appropriate code, and high-quality visualizations."
