      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook provides a reasonably good description of the Dandiset. It introduces the Dandiset 000673, explains that it contains neurophysiological recordings related to working memory and phase-amplitude coupling, and describes the Sternberg task used in the experiment. It provides context about the scientific question being addressed. However, it doesn't go into extensive detail about the dataset's structure, collection methods, or other metadata that would warrant a \"very well\" rating."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook shows how to load the Dandiset information very well. It uses the DANDI API client to connect to the archive, retrieves the Dandiset with ID \"000673\", lists all assets in the Dandiset, and prints the first five asset paths. This comprehensive approach demonstrates how to access and explore the Dandiset effectively."

    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook demonstrates loading basic information from an NWB file quite well. It shows how to load the NWB file for subject 35 using remfile and h5py, and then reads it using pynwb. It extracts and displays basic metadata including session description, file ID, start time, experimenter information, and subject details. It also shows how to extract trials data and convert it to a pandas DataFrame."

    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook loads several independent pieces of data from the NWB file:\n1. LFP data and sampling rate\n2. Electrode information\n3. Trials data (behavioral data)\n4. Stimulus image templates\n5. Stimulus presentation timing information\nThis demonstrates loading more than three independent pieces of data from the NWB file."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook visualizes multiple pieces of data from the NWB file:\n1. Behavioral data (accuracy and reaction time by memory load)\n2. Response accuracy by probe type\n3. LFP traces (5-second sample from all 8 channels)\n4. Power spectrum of LFP signals\n5. Power spectrum by trial phase\n6. Relative power spectrum by trial phase\n7. LFP spectrogram for one trial\n8. Stimulus images\n9. Stimulus presentation timing\n10. Theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling analysis\nThis demonstrates visualization of more than three independent pieces of data from the NWB file."

      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The plot quality in the notebook is mixed. Some plots are reasonably good, such as the behavioral data plots and power spectrum plots. However, there are several issues with other plots:\n1. The LFP traces plot has scaling and offset issues with unclear y-axis labeling\n2. The stimulus images are rotated 90 degrees without explanation\n3. The spectrogram has poor frequency resolution\n4. The phase-amplitude coupling plot is simplistic and not well explained\n\nThese issues suggest that the plot quality is only reasonably good, not very good."

      "thinking": "There are several major issues with the plots in the notebook:\n1. The LFP traces plot has scaling and offset issues with unclear y-axis labeling\n2. The stimulus images are rotated 90 degrees without explanation or correction\n3. The spectrogram has poor frequency resolution making it unsuitable for the intended analysis\n4. The phase-amplitude coupling plots are simplistic and not well explained\n\nThese constitute at least two major issues."

    {
      "question_id": "analysis-issues",
      "grade": -3,
      "thinking": "There are multiple major issues with the analysis in the notebook:\n1. The maintenance and retrieval phases use arbitrary fixed windows of 1 second due to missing endpoint timestamps\n2. The padding implementation in compute_power_spectrum is problematic and artificially alters the power spectrum\n3. Analysis is often performed on too few trials (sometimes just one) to draw meaningful conclusions\n4. The theta-gamma coupling analysis is not actually measuring coupling but only showing filtered signals\n5. Analysis parameters like nperseg=128 result in poor frequency resolution (~3.1 Hz)\n\nThese constitute more than two major issues."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": -3,
      "thinking": "The notebook draws several major unsupported conclusions:\n1. It makes interpretations about differences in power spectral density across task phases based on flawed analysis with small sample sizes and crude estimation techniques\n2. It claims to identify theta-gamma coupling based on simplistic analysis of a single trial\n3. It makes specific claims about neural activity during different phases of the working memory task without adequate statistical analysis\n4. It offers interpretations of spectrogram data despite acknowledging poor frequency resolution\n\nThese constitute at least two major unsupported conclusions."

    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "There are a few other issues with the notebook:\n1. The notebook doesn't address the warning about potential data transposition in the LFP data that appears during file loading\n2. The line `accuracies = [in_out_accuracy.get(pt, 0) for pt in probe_types]` could mask errors by defaulting to 0\n3. The summary in the final cell doesn't acknowledge the serious limitations of the analyses performed\n4. There's frequent use of weasel words like \"notable,\" \"suggesting,\" \"may reflect\" to avoid making clear statements\n\nThese constitute at least one major issue (ignoring the data transposition warning) and some minor issues."
