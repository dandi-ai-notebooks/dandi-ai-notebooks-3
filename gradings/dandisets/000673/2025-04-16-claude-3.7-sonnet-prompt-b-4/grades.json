    {
      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook provides a good introduction to the Dandiset, mentioning that it contains neurophysiological recordings related to working memory and phase-amplitude coupling. It includes background information on the Sternberg task used in the experiment and outlines the key findings of the original research. The description is reasonably detailed though not extensive."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook demonstrates loading the Dandiset using the DANDI API client, retrieving the Dandiset with ID \"000673\", and listing available assets. It shows how to connect to the DANDI archive and verify the connection was established correctly. The process is clearly shown."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook shows how to load an NWB file from the Dandiset using remfile and h5py to access it remotely and pynwb to read it. It displays basic metadata from the NWB file including session description, file ID, experimenter information, and subject details. It effectively extracts and presents key information from the NWB file structure."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook demonstrates loading multiple pieces of data from the NWB file: 1) trials data converted to a pandas DataFrame, 2) LFP data and its sampling rate, 3) electrode information, 4) stimulus image templates, and 5) stimulus presentation timing information. This covers three or more independent pieces of data from the NWB file."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook visualizes several types of data from the NWB file: 1) behavioral data (accuracy by memory load, reaction time by memory load, response accuracy by probe type), 2) LFP traces from multiple channels, 3) power spectrum of LFP signals, 4) power spectrum by trial phase, 5) LFP spectrogram, 6) stimulus images, 7) stimulus presentation timing, and 8) theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling. This shows more than three independent visualizations of the data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "advanced-visualization",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook attempts several advanced visualizations that combine multiple types of data, including time-frequency representation (spectrogram) with event markers, and theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling analysis. However, these visualizations have significant flaws in their implementation and interpretation as noted in the critique. The spectrograms have poor frequency resolution, and the phase-amplitude coupling analysis is based on limited data with methodological issues. While attempts were made, the quality of these advanced visualizations is questionable."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The plots in the notebook have several issues: rotated face images, poorly labeled y-axes in some plots, use of arbitrary parameters without justification, and plots based on limited data that lead to potentially misleading visualizations. While some plots like behavioral data visualizations are reasonably good, others have significant quality issues that impact their interpretability."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": -3,
      "thinking": "The critique identified multiple major issues with the plots: 1) LFP traces have weird scaling and offset with poorly labeled y-axis, 2) face images are rotated 90 degrees without explanation or correction, 3) spectrograms have poor frequency resolution due to inappropriate parameters, 4) phase-amplitude coupling analysis uses arbitrary bins without rationale and is based on limited data. These constitute at least two major issues."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-redundancy",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "There doesn't appear to be excessive redundancy between plots in the notebook. Each visualization appears to serve a distinct purpose, showing different aspects of the data or different analyses."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": -3,
      "thinking": "The notebook makes several unsupported conclusions, particularly in the sections on trial phase analysis and theta-gamma coupling. It makes speculative interpretations based on limited data (often just a single trial), using arbitrary parameters, and with methodological flaws. The critique specifically identifies overreaching claims about neural activity during different task phases and about phase-amplitude coupling that are not adequately supported by the analyses performed. These constitute at least two major unsupported conclusions."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": -3,
      "thinking": "Other issues include: 1) Using fixed time windows rather than extracting actual durations from the NWB file for maintenance and retrieval phases, 2) Using a small number of trials (often just one) for analyses that require larger datasets to be valid, 3) Inappropriate handling of data segments (e.g., padding) that can artificially alter results, 4) Hard-coding channel selection without proper justification. These represent at least two major issues that impact the validity of the analyses."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "overall-effectiveness",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook effectively demonstrates basic loading and visualization of data from the Dandiset, including trials information, LFP data, and stimulus images. However, it has significant flaws in the more advanced analyses, particularly in the time-frequency and phase-amplitude coupling sections. The interpretations often go beyond what the data actually shows, making claims that aren't sufficiently supported. While the introduction to the dataset and basic data loading are useful, the analytical portions contain too many methodological issues to be considered effective for analysis. It provides a starting point but would require substantial revisions to be truly effective."
