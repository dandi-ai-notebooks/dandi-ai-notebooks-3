      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook does a good job of describing the Dandiset. Cell 3 provides a concise summary of Dandiset 000673, mentioning the study by Daume et al. (2025), the focus on working memory, phase-amplitude coupling, and the brain regions involved. This gives users a good understanding of the underlying research."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook shows how to load information about the Dandiset quite well. Cell 7 uses the dandi-api library to connect to the DANDI archive, retrieve Dandiset 000673, list the assets (NWB files) within it, and print the paths of the first five assets."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook demonstrates loading basic information from an NWB file well. In Cell 9, it uses pynwb, h5py, and remfile to load an NWB file and then prints the NWB object showing metadata. Cells 11-13 further extract and display specific metadata attributes (session_description, identifier, and session_start_time)."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook shows how to load multiple types of data from the NWB file:\n1. LFP data (Cell 15)\n2. Stimulus event data and timestamps (Cell 18)\n3. Stimulus template images (Cell 20)\nThese represent three independent pieces of data loaded from the NWB file."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook visualizes multiple types of data from the NWB file:\n1. LFP data (Cell 16) - visualizes the first 1000 timepoints for the first 10 channels\n2. Stimulus event data (Cell 18) - plots event values against time for the first 100 events\n3. Stimulus template images (Cell 20) - displays the first image using matplotlib.pyplot.imshow()\nThese represent three independent pieces of data being visualized."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The plots are reasonably good quality with proper axes and titles, but there are some issues with labels and context. For example, the LFP plot likely has an incorrect unit (volts instead of microvolts), and the stimulus event plot has a vague \"Event Value\" label without explaining what the values represent. The plots are functional but could be improved with better labeling and context."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "There are multiple issues with the plots:\n1. The LFP plot likely has an incorrect y-axis label (\"LFP (volts)\" instead of microvolts)\n2. The potential transposition issue with LFP data mentioned in a warning is not addressed\n3. The stimulus event plot has a vague \"Event Value\" label without explanation\n4. There's a general lack of context for what the plots represent (e.g., brain regions for the LFP channels)\nThese represent several minor issues and at least one potentially major issue (the transposition warning that might affect data interpretation)."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "analysis-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "There are some minor issues with the analysis:\n1. The warning about potentially transposed data in the LFP ElectricalSeries is not addressed\n2. There's little context provided for interpreting the data being visualized\n3. The relationship between the stimulus events and stimulus images is not explained\nThese are primarily minor issues as the notebook doesn't claim to perform advanced analysis, but they could affect basic understanding of the data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook doesn't appear to draw any unsupported conclusions. It primarily focuses on loading and visualizing data without making significant claims about the data's meaning or implications. Cell 21 summarizes what was covered and suggests future directions without making overreaching statements."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "There are some minor issues not covered in other categories:\n1. The notebook doesn't fully address the warning about potentially transposed data\n2. There's insufficient explanation of what the stimulus event values represent\n3. The relationship between different data modalities (LFP, events, images) could be better explained\nThese are generally minor issues that don't severely impact the notebook's usefulness but would improve it if addressed."
