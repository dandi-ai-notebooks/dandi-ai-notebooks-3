    {
      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook provides a comprehensive description of Dandiset 000673 in Cell 3, including its content (human intracranial recordings during a Sternberg working memory task), the number of subjects, and the research question addressed. It also includes a Neurosift link for interactive exploration."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "Cell 7 shows how to load information about the Dandiset using the dandi library, retrieving the list of assets, and displaying their paths. The implementation is clear and effective."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "Cells this 8-11 demonstrate how to load an NWB file from the DANDI archive using remfile, h5py, and pynwb, and how to extract basic metadata such as session details and subject information. The implementation is thorough and well-explained."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook loads multiple independent pieces of data from the NWB file: trial data (Cell 13), electrode information (Cell 22), LFP data (Cell 25), and single-unit neural recordings (Cell 35-37). Each type of data is loaded, processed, and used for further analysis."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook visualizes multiple independent pieces of data: task performance by memory load (Cell 15), reaction time by memory load (Cell 17), distribution of trial types (Cell 19), LFP traces (Cell 27), power spectral density (Cell 30), LFP band power (Cell 32), number of spikes per unit (Cell 37), spike raster plots and PSTH (Cell 40), and average firing rates across task periods (Cell 43)."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The plots generally convey the intended information well with appropriate labels, titles, and visual clarity. However, there are some issues with axis labeling, overlapping labels, and a potentially cut-off legend in one plot."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "Several issues were identified in the plots: 1) The y-axis label for reaction time says \"seconds\" but the text displays milliseconds (Cell 17), 2) The y-axis units for LFP voltage appear implausibly high (Cell 27), 3) There are overlapping axis labels in some plots (Cell 27), 4) The legend is partially cut off in one plot (Cell 32), 5) The raster plot alignment could be improved to better show task-relevant epochs (Cell 40)."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "analysis-issues",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "Major analysis issues include: 1) The y-axis units for LFP voltage seem incorrect throughout the LFP analysis, 2) The spike counting logic for the fixation period appears incorrect in Cell 43, affecting the comparison of firing rates across task periods, 3) The raster plot does not account for trials of different lengths, which confounds the PSTH result."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "Several unsupported conclusions are made: 1) Claims about \"large deflections\" in LFP representing significant neural events (Cell 28) without event markers, 2) Definitive statements about a neuron being involved in working memory maintenance based on visual inspection without statistical testing (Cell 41), 3) Claims about highest firing rates during the Maintenance period (Cell 44) despite the coding issue in the analysis and lack of statistical significance."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "Minor issues include: 1) The characterization of the PSD as exhibiting a \"classic 1/f slope\" is misleading as it flattens out by 20 Hz (Cell 31), 2) Failure to note that the prominent dip at 60 Hz corresponds to electrical grid noise, 3) Lack of statistical tests to support observations about neural activity differences."
