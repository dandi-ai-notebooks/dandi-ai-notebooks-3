    {
      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook does a thorough job of describing the Dandiset. Cell 3 provides a comprehensive overview of Dandiset 000673, including the experiment type (human intracranial recordings during a Sternberg working memory task), the number of subjects, and the research question addressed. It also includes a Neurosift link for interactive exploration. The description is clear and informative."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook demonstrates how to load information about the Dandiset effectively. Cell 7 shows how to use the `dandi` library to access Dandiset 000673, retrieve the list of assets (files), and display information about them (count and paths). This provides a good foundation for working with the Dandiset."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook effectively shows how to load basic information from an NWB file. Cell 9 demonstrates loading an NWB file using `remfile`, `h5py`, and `pynwb` libraries. Cell 11 extracts and displays metadata from the NWB file, including session details and subject information. Together, these cells provide a clear demonstration of accessing basic NWB file information."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook loads multiple independent pieces of data from the NWB file:\n1. Trial data (Cell 13) - loads behavioral data from the Sternberg task\n2. Electrode information (Cell 22) - loads electrode locations and properties\n3. LFP data (Cell 25) - loads local field potential recordings\n4. Single unit data (Cell 35) - loads spike times and unit information\nThis represents at least four independent data types being loaded from the NWB file."

    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook visualizes multiple independent pieces of data:\n1. Task performance by memory load (Cell 15) - bar graph of accuracy\n2. Reaction time by memory load (Cell 17) - bar graph of reaction times\n3. Distribution of trial types (Cell 19) - pie chart\n4. LFP traces (Cell 27) - time series plots\n5. Power spectral density of LFP (Cell 30) - frequency domain plot\n6. Band power by channel (Cell 32) - bar graph\n7. Spike counts per unit (Cell 37) - bar graph\n8. Raster plot and PSTH (Cell 40) - spike timing visualization\n9. Average firing rate across task periods (Cell 43) - bar graph\nThis demonstrates visualization of more than three independent data types."

    {
      "question_id": "advanced-visualization",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "Cell 40 creates an advanced visualization that combines multiple types of data from the NWB file. It generates a figure with two subplots: a spike raster plot showing individual spike times across trials (top) and a peri-stimulus time histogram showing the average firing rate over time (bottom). The visualization includes color coding for different memory load conditions and vertical lines indicating key task events (fixation, probe, response). This effectively combines spike time data with trial event data to provide insight into neural activity patterns across the task."

    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The plots in the notebook are generally of good quality. They include proper axis labels, titles, and legends where appropriate. The use of seaborn styling enhances readability. However, there are some issues noted with axis scaling and overlapping labels in some plots (e.g., Cells 27, 32). Despite these minor issues, the plots effectively communicate the data analysis and provide visual insights into the dataset."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "There are several minor issues with the plots:\n1. In Cell 27, the y-axis is labeled \"Voltage (V)\" but the range seems implausibly high for LFP data, which is typically in the microvolt range.\n2. In Cell 27, axis labels overlap with the subplots, indicating issues with layout.\n3. In Cell 32, the legend is partially cut off.\n4. In Cell 17, there's inconsistency between the y-axis label (in seconds) and the printed text (in milliseconds).\nThese are all minor issues that don't prevent understanding the plots but affect their professional appearance."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "analysis-issues",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "There are some major issues with the analysis:\n1. In Cell 43, there appears to be a coding error in the spike counting logic for the fixation period, which affects the validity of the subsequent firing rate comparisons.\n2. The LFP voltage scale issues (Cells 27, 30, 32) raise questions about the correctness of the power calculations and subsequent interpretations.\nThese issues significantly impact the validity of some key analyses in the notebook."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "There are multiple instances of unsupported conclusions:\n1. In Cell 28, claiming that large deflections in the LFP \"likely represent significant neural events\" is speculative without event markers.\n2. In Cell 31, the statement about \"classic 1/f slope\" is misleading as the PSD flattens out by 20 Hz.\n3. In Cell 41, the conclusion that the neuron is involved in working memory maintenance is too definitive based on the visual inspection alone without statistical testing.\n4. In Cell 44, claiming that the highest firing rates occur during the Maintenance period is unsupported given the issues with the firing rate calculation and lack of statistical testing.\nThese represent at least two major unsupported conclusions."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "There are some minor issues not covered in the previous categories:\n1. The raster plot in Cell 40 aligns the response to trial start, but it might be more useful to align it to probe or response onset.\n2. The analysis does not account for trials of different lengths, which could confound the PSTH result.\n3. Several analyses would benefit from statistical tests to verify the observed patterns.\nThese are minor methodological concerns that don't invalidate the notebook but could be improved."
