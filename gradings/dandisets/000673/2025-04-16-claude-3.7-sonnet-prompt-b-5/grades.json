    {
      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook provides a thorough description of Dandiset 000673, including the experiment type (human intracranial recordings during a Sternberg working memory task), the number of subjects, and the research question addressed. Cell 3 specifically provides this overview along with a Neurosift link for interactive exploration."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook demonstrates how to load information about the Dandiset effectively. Cell 7 uses the dandi library to access Dandiset 000673, retrieve the list of assets, and display information about the first 5 assets along with the total count."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook shows how to load basic information from an NWB file in cells 9-11. It uses remfile, h5py, and pynwb libraries to access the file and extract metadata including session details and subject information."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook demonstrates loading multiple types of data from the NWB file: 1) Trial data in cells 13-14, 2) Electrode location information in cells 22-23, 3) LFP data in cell 25, 4) Single unit recording data in cells 35-36, and 5) Spike times in cell 37. This constitutes more than three independent pieces of data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook visualizes several different types of data: 1) Task performance accuracy by memory load (cell 15), 2) Reaction time by memory load (cell 17), 3) Distribution of trial types (cell 19), 4) LFP traces for multiple channels (cell 27), 5) Power spectral density of LFP data (cell 30), 6) Band power in different frequency ranges (cell 32), 7) Number of spikes per unit (cell 37), 8) Raster plot and PSTH for a single unit (cell 40), and 9) Average firing rates across task periods (cell 43). This constitutes more than three independent visualizations."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "advanced-visualization",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook includes at least one advanced visualization in cell 40, which combines a spike raster plot with a peri-stimulus time histogram (PSTH) and overlays task event markers (fixation, probe, and response times). This visualization effectively integrates multiple types of data (spike times, trial information, memory load conditions, and task events)."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The plots in the notebook are generally of good quality with appropriate labels, titles, and color schemes. Most plots have clear axes, appropriate scaling, and informative legends when needed. However, there are issues with some plots, such as y-axis labeling problems and layout issues, which prevent them from being considered \"very good quality\"."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": -3,
      "thinking": "There are several issues with the plots: 1) In cell 27, the y-axis is labeled \"Voltage (V)\" with implausibly high values for LFP, 2) Axis labels overlap with subplots in some figures, suggesting layout issues, 3) In cell 30, the y-axis units are incorrect based on the voltage amplitudes, 4) In cell 32, the legend is partially cut off, 5) In cell 43, there appear to be coding issues that affect the visualization of firing rates during fixation periods. These constitute at least two major issues."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-redundancy",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "There doesn't appear to be excessive redundancy between the plots in the notebook. Each visualization focuses on a different aspect of the data or presents the data in a different way."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": -3,
      "thinking": "There are several unsupported conclusions in the notebook: 1) In cell 28, the statement that large LFP deflections \"likely represent significant neural events\" is made without evidence, 2) In cell 31, the claim about the PSD showing \"a classic 1/f slope\" is misleading as the PSD flattens out by 20 Hz, 3) In cell 41, the conclusion about the neuron being involved in working memory maintenance is too definitive based on the visual inspection alone, 4) In cell 44, the claim about highest firing rates occurring during the Maintenance period is not supported by the data shown. These constitute at least two major unsupported conclusions."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "There are other issues in the notebook: 1) The y-axis units problem appears consistently throughout the LFP analysis, 2) There is a coding issue in cell 43 regarding calculation of firing rates in fixation periods, 3) In cell 17, there's a discrepancy between the y-axis label showing \"seconds\" and the printed text displaying milliseconds. These constitute at least one major issue (the recurring y-axis units problem) and some minor issues."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "overall-effectiveness",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "Despite the issues identified, the notebook is generally effective at introducing the Dandiset, demonstrating how to load data, and showcasing various visualization techniques. It provides a comprehensive exploration of the dataset, covering behavioral data, LFP recordings, and single-unit activity. The issues with unit labeling, some unsupported conclusions, and coding problems detract from its effectiveness, but overall it serves as a reasonable starting point for working with this dataset."
