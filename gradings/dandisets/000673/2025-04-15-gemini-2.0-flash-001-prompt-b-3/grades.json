    {
      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook introduces Dandiset 000673, summarizes the research question it addresses, and outlines the notebook's objectives. The introduction appears to provide a high-level overview of the Dandiset, which seems reasonably adequate."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook establishes a connection to the DANDI Archive using the dandiapi client, retrieves Dandiset 000673, and lists the assets (files) within the Dandiset. It demonstrates how to access the Dandiset and browse the available files, which is done reasonably well."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook loads an NWB file using pynwb, h5py, and remfile, and displays its metadata. It also demonstrates how to access specific metadata attributes such as session description, identifier, and session start time. The loading of basic information is done well, though there is a warning about data potentially being transposed that needs attention."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook loads two distinct pieces of data: LFP (Local Field Potential) data and stimulus template images. Both are loaded separately and used for visualization. It doesn't appear that a third independent data type is loaded."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook visualizes two types of data: 1) LFP data for the first five channels over the first 10 seconds, and 2) stimulus template images. Both are shown with appropriate plots/visualizations."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The plots for the LFP data display the time series data with proper labeling of axes and titles. The stimulus template images are displayed clearly, though they are rotated 45 degrees counter-clockwise. Overall, the plots are reasonably good quality despite some issues."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "There are two notable issues with the plots: 1) The LFP data visualization may be affected by the transposed data warning that was not addressed, potentially leading to incorrect visualization; and 2) The stimulus template images are rotated 45 degrees counter-clockwise and this rotation is not corrected or mentioned. The rotation issue is described as a serious flaw, making this at least one major issue."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "analysis-issues",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "There is a potential issue with the analysis of LFP data. The `num_channels` variable is determined assuming time is the first axis, but the warning when loading the NWB file indicates that data may be transposed. This could lead to incorrect channel selection or analysis. This appears to be a major issue that could significantly affect the results."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook doesn't appear to draw any unsupported conclusions. It primarily focuses on loading and visualizing data, and the summary at the end suggests potential avenues for further analysis without making claims about the data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The main issues have been covered in the plot-issues and analysis-issues sections. There don't appear to be other significant issues with the notebook."
