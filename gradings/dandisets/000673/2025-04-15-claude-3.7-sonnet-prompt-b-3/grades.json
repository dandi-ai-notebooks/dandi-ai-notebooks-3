    {
      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook provides a good description of Dandiset 000673 in Cell 3, mentioning that it contains LFP data, single neuron recordings, behavioral data, and stimulus information from epilepsy patients. It also provides context about the research question being addressed and links to the GitHub repository. This is a reasonably thorough description."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook introduces loading the Dandiset in Cell 6, mentioning both the direct URL approach and the alternative DANDI API approach. Cell 7 defines the URL for the first subject's NWB file and prints information about the Dandiset. This shows a clear approach to loading Dandiset information."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "Cell 9 loads the NWB file using remfile and h5py/pynwb, and Cell 11 prints basic metadata from the file (session description, identifier, start time, etc.). The notebook effectively demonstrates how to load and access basic information from an NWB file."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook shows how to load multiple independent pieces of data from the NWB file:\n1. Electrode information (Cell 13)\n2. LFP data (Cells 15-17)\n3. Trial information (Cell 19)\n4. Single unit data (Cell 23)\n5. Stimulus image data (Cell 29)\nThis covers more than three independent pieces of data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook visualizes multiple independent pieces of data:\n1. Electrode distribution across brain regions (Cell 13)\n2. LFP data from different brain regions (Cell 17)\n3. LFP data during a specific trial (Cell 19)\n4. Time-frequency analysis of LFP data (Cell 21)\n5. Single unit raster plots (Cell 25)\n6. Unit firing rates across trial phases (Cell 27)\n7. Stimulus images (Cell 29)\n8. Stimulus presentation sequence (Cell 31)\n9. Behavioral performance (Cell 33)\nThis covers more than three independent visualizations."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "advanced-visualization",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "Cell 21 creates an advanced visualization that combines LFP time series data with a spectrogram showing frequency content, and also incorporates timing information about different trial phases. This combines multiple types of data (LFP signal, frequency content, trial events) in a single informative visualization. Despite some issues with the x-axis, this still qualifies as an advanced visualization attempt."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "Some plots in the notebook are of reasonably good quality, with appropriate labels and clarity (like the electrode distribution plot in Cell 13 and the LFP plots in Cell 17). However, there are several issues with other plots, including incorrect orientations of stimulus images (Cell 29), timing issues in raster plots (Cell 25), and potentially incorrect x-axis values in the trial phase plots (Cells 19 and 21). The overall quality is mixed."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": -3,
      "thinking": "There are several major issues with the plots:\n1. Timing issues in the trial phase plots (Cells 19 and 21) where the x-axis values seem incorrect\n2. Raster plots (Cell 25) have significant timing issues and all units display as \"Unknown\"\n3. Stimulus images (Cell 29) are rotated incorrectly\n4. Firing rate plots (Cell 27) show all units as \"Unknown\" due to electrode matching issues\nThese are major issues that significantly affect the interpretability of the visualizations."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "analysis-issues",
      "grade": -3,
      "thinking": "There are several major analysis issues in the notebook:\n1. The warnings about LFP data dimensions in Cell 9 suggest potential transposition issues that could lead to incorrect analysis\n2. The timing calculations for trial phases in Cells 19 and 21 appear to be incorrect\n3. The electrode matching for single units in Cells 23, 25, and 27 is problematic, resulting in all units being labeled as \"Unknown\"\n4. The logic for handling multiple electrodes per unit in Cell 23 is simplistic and may not be appropriate\nThese issues significantly impact the validity of the analyses presented."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "Cell 34 summarizes \"key observations\" from the notebook, but many of these may be inaccurate due to the various issues with the analyses. The critique specifically mentions that \"because of all the issues related to broken code, many Key Observations may not be 100% accurate.\" This constitutes at least one major unsupported conclusion."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The main other issue is that the notebook fails to properly complete analysis within a single subject, as mentioned in the critique of Cell 34. This is a significant limitation given that the notebook suggests analysis across multiple subjects as a future direction. However, this issue is already captured in the analysis issues section, and there don't appear to be other major issues that haven't been covered."
