    {
      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook provides a good description of Dandiset 000673 in Cell 3, mentioning that it contains LFP data, single neuron recordings, behavioral data, and stimulus information from epilepsy patients performing a Sternberg working memory task. It also provides a link to the associated GitHub repository. The overview is reasonably comprehensive but could potentially include more details about the specific research questions or methodology."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook shows how to load information about the Dandiset in Cells 6-7, explaining the approach of using the asset URL directly and mentioning the alternative of using the DANDI API. It defines the URL for the first subject's NWB file and prints information about the Dandiset. This is done reasonably well, though it could potentially demonstrate more comprehensive metadata retrieval."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "Cells 9-13 show how to load basic information from an NWB file. Cell 9 loads the NWB file using remfile and h5py/pynwb. Cell 11 prints basic metadata information including session description, identifier, start time, and subject information. Cell 13 retrieves electrode information. This is done reasonably well, with good exploration of metadata."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook loads several independent pieces of data from the NWB file: 1) LFP data in Cell 15, 2) trial information in Cell 19, 3) single unit data in Cell 23, and 4) stimulus image data in Cell 29. This demonstrates loading multiple different types of data from the NWB file."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook visualizes multiple independent pieces of data: 1) electrode distribution across brain regions in Cell 13, 2) LFP time series from different brain regions in Cell 17, 3) LFP during a specific trial in Cell 19, 4) time-frequency analysis (spectrogram) in Cell 21, 5) raster plots of spike timing in Cell 25, 6) firing rates across trial phases in Cell 27, 7) stimulus images in Cell 29, 8) stimulus presentation sequence in Cell 31, and 9) behavioral performance in Cell 33. This demonstrates a comprehensive approach to visualizing different aspects of the data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The plots have reasonable quality in terms of including proper labels, titles, and legends. However, there are issues with several plots (the x-axis timing in Cells 19 and 21, rotated images in Cell 29, and granularity issues in Cell 31), which prevent me from giving the highest rating."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": -3,
      "thinking": "Major issues: 1) The x-axis values in the LFP trial plots (Cell 19) are incorrect, making it difficult to draw valuable conclusions. 2) Similar x-axis timing issues exist in the spectrogram (Cell 21). 3) The stimulus images (Cell 29) are rotated incorrectly. 4) The raster plots (Cell 25) have significant timing issues, and all units display location as \"Unknown\" when they should have proper locations. These are serious issues that affect the interpretation of the data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "analysis-issues",
      "grade": -3,
      "thinking": "Major issues: 1) Cell 9 has warnings about LFP data dimensions being potentially transposed incorrectly, which could lead to incorrect analysis. 2) Cell 23's logic for dealing with multiple electrodes is problematic (it simply takes the first electrode). 3) Cell 25's spike timing analysis has significant issues with \"Unknown\" locations and negative x-axis scale. 4) Cell 27's firing rate analysis also suffers from the \"Unknown\" location issue, lacking meaningful interpretation. These issues significantly impact the validity of the analyses."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "Cell 34 summarizes key observations from the analyses, but many of these may not be accurate due to the issues with the code and plots identified throughout the notebook. Since the analyses have significant problems with timing and electrode locations, the conclusions drawn about neural activity patterns during different trial phases are likely unsupported. This constitutes a major unsupported conclusion."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "There are several additional issues: 1) The notebook occasionally uses hardcoded values (e.g., `available_regions[:4]`) which assumes characteristics of the data that might not be true. 2) There's vague titling of axes in several plots. 3) The handling of potential errors around \"Unknown\" conditions needs careful testing. These are relatively minor issues compared to the analysis problems."
