    {
      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook provides a reasonable description of the Dandiset 000673, including its focus on phase-amplitude coupling in hippocampal neurons during working memory tasks, the brain regions involved (medial temporal and frontal lobes), and the types of data available (LFP and events). It gives enough context to understand the scientific purpose of the dataset."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook successfully loads information about the Dandiset using the dandiapi client. It retrieves the list of assets and displays the number of assets found along with the paths of the first five assets, giving users a good idea of the dataset's contents."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook shows how to load an NWB file from the Dandiset using remfile, h5py, and pynwb. It successfully accesses the file structure and prepares it for data extraction, demonstrating the basic methods for working with NWB files."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook demonstrates loading one type of data - LFP (Local Field Potential) data from the NWB file. It extracts the first 1000 timepoints from the first 10 channels. However, it doesn't load other independent pieces of data that might be available in the dataset."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook visualizes one type of data - the LFP data extracted from the NWB file. It creates a plot showing the LFP data for the first 10 channels over time. However, it doesn't visualize any other types of data that might be available."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "advanced-visualization",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook does not create an advanced visualization involving multiple types of data. It only displays a basic plot of LFP data for multiple channels, but doesn't combine this with other data types or create more sophisticated visualizations."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The plot is of reasonable quality. It shows the LFP data for multiple channels with a legend indicating which line corresponds to which channel. The axes are labeled and the plot has a title explaining what is being visualized."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "There is a minor issue with the plot: the y-axis is labeled \"Voltage [V]\" but the plot displays unitless values due to the addition of arbitrary offsets (i*0.1) to separate the channels visually. This could make it difficult to interpret the actual voltage values."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "analysis-issues",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "There are no significant analysis issues noted. The notebook performs basic data loading and visualization without attempting complex analyses that could introduce errors."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook doesn't draw any unsupported conclusions. It focuses on data exploration without making claims about the scientific results or interpretations of the data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "No other significant issues are mentioned in the critique. The notebook appropriately warns that it is AI-generated and may contain inaccuracies, setting proper expectations for users."
