    {
      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook provides a good description of the Dandiset in cells 2 and 3, explaining that it's about phase-amplitude coupling in working memory, focusing on medial temporal and frontal lobes, and mentioning single neuron activity, theta-gamma coupling, and the types of data available (LFP and events). However, it doesn't go into extensive detail about the experimental conditions, subject information, or other specific metadata that would make it \"very well\" described."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "Cell 5 shows how to load information about the Dandiset using the dandiapi client. It retrieves the assets (files) within the Dandiset and prints the number of assets and the paths of the first five. This is a reasonable demonstration of loading basic Dandiset information, but it doesn't explore or display comprehensive metadata about the Dandiset itself."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "Cell 6 demonstrates loading an NWB file using remfile, h5py, and pynwb. It shows how to access the LFP data within the file structure, but it doesn't explore other basic information from the NWB file such as metadata, experimental details, or subject information that would provide a more comprehensive view of the NWB file contents."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook only shows loading one type of data - the LFP data in cell 6. There's no evidence of loading other independent pieces of data like spike times, behavioral events, or other neural signals that might be present in the dataset."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook only visualizes one type of data - the LFP signals from multiple channels in cell 6. There are no other visualizations of different data types from the NWB file."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The plot in cell 6 is reasonably good. It shows multiple LFP channels with appropriate time on the x-axis, includes a title and legend to identify channels, and has labeled axes. However, the critique points out issues with the y-axis units and artificial channel offsetting that could be improved."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "There is a minor issue with the plot in cell 6 as noted in the critique. The y-axis is labeled as \"Voltage [V]\" but the plotted values include arbitrary offsets (i*0.1) to separate the channels visually, making the voltage scale misleading. This is a minor issue that doesn't prevent understanding the visualization but could be improved for accuracy."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "analysis-issues",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "There isn't much analysis in the notebook beyond loading and basic visualization. The notebook doesn't attempt to analyze phase-amplitude coupling or perform statistical tests, so there aren't really any analysis issues to identify."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook doesn't appear to draw any unsupported conclusions based on the critique. It presents the data and suggests further analyses in cell 7, but doesn't make claims about the results that would be unsupported."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "No other significant issues are mentioned in the critique. The notebook appropriately warns users that it's AI-generated in cell 1, provides necessary package imports in cell 4, and properly closes files in cell 7."
