    {
      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook introduces Dandiset 000673 well, mentioning its focus on working memory and phase-amplitude coupling in human brain recordings. The introduction includes good context and it ties back to this focus in the conclusion. However, there isn't an extensive description of the dataset."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook uses the DANDI API to access Dandiset 000673, initializes a DandiAPIClient, retrieves the specified dandiset, and gets a list of assets (NWB files). It shows the total number of assets and the paths of the first five assets, which gives a good overview of the dataset structure."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook loads a specific NWB file and extracts key metadata elements (session description, identifier, session start time, and experimenter). However, it uses a hardcoded URL rather than selecting an asset dynamically from the assets list obtained earlier, which is less flexible."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook loads two pieces of data from an NWB file: 1) LFP data for visualization and 2) Events data. Both are successfully loaded, though there are some issues with how they're used later."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook visualizes two independent pieces of data: 1) LFP data showing time series for 10 channels and 2) Events data as a line plot. While both visualizations have issues (discussed in plot-issues), they do demonstrate basic visualization capabilities."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "advanced-visualization",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook does not create any advanced visualizations that combine multiple types of data. The visualizations shown are basic time series plots of individual data types."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The plots shown are functional but have several issues. The LFP plot doesn't indicate which channel each line represents, and the Events plot lacks context to make it interpretable. The plots are basic and don't include elements that would make them more informative, like proper units or legends."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "There are several major issues with the plots: 1) The LFP plot has incorrect units on the x-axis, doesn't identify channels, and has a misleading title for the y-axis. 2) The Events plot lacks context, making it uninformative, and has an inaccurate title. These issues significantly impact the usefulness and interpretability of the visualizations."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "analysis-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "There are some minor issues with the analysis approach. The hardcoded URL makes the notebook less general. The lack of sampling rate consideration when plotting LFP data could lead to misinterpretation. The notebook also doesn't properly consider the warning about potentially transposed data, which could affect analysis results."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook doesn't make any unsupported conclusions. It primarily focuses on loading and visualizing data, with suggestions for future analysis rather than drawing conclusions from the current analysis."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "There are some minor issues not covered in other categories: 1) Warning messages about namespace versions and shape of ElectricalSeries data that aren't addressed. 2) The notebook could benefit from more explanatory text about the data structure and what various elements represent."
