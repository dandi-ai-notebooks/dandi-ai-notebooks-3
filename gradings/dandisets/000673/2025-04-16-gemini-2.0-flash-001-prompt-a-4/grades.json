    {
      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook provides a reasonably good description of the Dandiset in cells 1, 3, and 4. It includes the Dandiset ID (000673), title, a brief summary of the study's objective (role of phase-amplitude coupling in human hippocampal neurons for working memory control), and mentions the authors. However, there are some issues like an incorrect publication year (2025) and a potentially incorrect Neurosift link. Overall, the description is adequate but not exceptional."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook demonstrates how to load the Dandiset metadata very well in cells 6-7. It uses the DANDI API to connect to the archive, retrieve Dandiset 000673, list the assets, and display information about the first five assets. This provides a clear and effective introduction to accessing the Dandiset."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook shows how to load basic information from an NWB file very well in cells 8-9. It specifies which NWB file to load, provides the URL, and uses pynwb, h5py, and remfile to load the file. It then prints key metadata like the NWB file object, session description, identifier, and session start time. The warning about the dimension of the ElectricalSeries is noted but doesn't detract from the loading process itself."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook shows how to load three independent pieces of data from the NWB file: LFP data (cell 11), event data (cell 13), and stimulus presentation data (cell 15). Each type of data is loaded correctly, though there are some issues with how the data is processed or interpreted after loading."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook visualizes three independent pieces of data: LFP data (cell 11), event data (cell 13), and stimulus presentation data (cell 15). Each visualization shows the respective data type over time, providing basic insights into the temporal patterns of the data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "advanced-visualization",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook does not create any advanced visualization involving multiple types of data. All visualizations are simple time series plots of individual data types (LFP, events, or stimuli) without integration or comparison between different data types."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The plots in the notebook are of reasonably good quality. They include appropriate axes labels, titles, and use seaborn styling. However, as noted in the issues for cells 11, 13, and 15, there are some limitations in the plots' informativeness due to ambiguous labels (e.g., \"Event Type\", \"Stimulus Index\") and potential misinterpretation of the data structure (e.g., possible need to transpose the LFP data). The plots are functional but could be more informative with better context and design choices."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "There are several issues with the plots:\n1. In cell 11, the LFP data may need to be transposed based on the warning in cell 9, and the y-axis label could be more specific about units.\n2. In cell 13, \"Event Type\" is ambiguous without explaining what the values represent.\n3. In cell 15, \"Stimulus Index\" is unclear without context about what these indices refer to.\n4. In both cells 13 and 15, the x-axis extends beyond the plotted data, making the plots wider than necessary.\nThese are significant issues that affect the interpretation of the data, so I would consider them major issues."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "analysis-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "There are some minor analysis issues:\n1. The LFP timestamps are recalculated in cell 11 instead of directly using the timestamps from the NWB file.\n2. The notebook doesn't verify that the data is correctly oriented after noting a warning about potential transposition needs.\n3. The analyses are very basic, limited to visualization without deeper exploration of the data's properties or relationships.\nThese issues don't fundamentally invalidate the analysis but represent missed opportunities for more robust analysis."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook doesn't appear to draw any unsupported conclusions. It primarily focuses on loading and visualizing data without making claims about patterns or relationships in the data. Cell 16 suggests potential future analyses but doesn't make premature conclusions about what those analyses might show."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "There are a few minor issues:\n1. In cell 3, the publication year is listed as 2025, which is likely incorrect.\n2. In cell 3, the Neurosift link appears to be incorrect (linking to dandiset 001176/000673 instead of 000673).\n3. In cell 5, the list of required packages omits 'dandi', which is used in later cells.\nThese are minor issues that don't significantly impact the notebook's functionality but should be corrected for accuracy."
