    {
      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "Based on the critique, the notebook provides a very good description of Dandiset 000673. It explains that it contains recordings from Macro-Micro Hybrid Depth Electrodes in medial temporal lobe and medial frontal cortex regions, focusing on the hippocampus and amygdala. It describes the experiment, recording methods, and key research findings related to theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling and working memory. It also provides a link to the Neurosift interface for more details."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook demonstrates how to load information about the Dandiset very well. It connects to the DANDI archive using the dandi package, retrieves Dandiset 000673, and lists the first five assets (NWB files) within the Dandiset. It prints the Dandiset ID, name, total number of assets, and information about the first 5 assets. It also explains how to access a specific file using remfile to stream the data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook effectively shows how to load basic information from an NWB file. It selects a specific subject (Subject 20), constructs the URL for accessing the file via the DANDI API, opens the remote file using remfile, and reads it into an NWB object using pynwb. It then extracts and displays basic metadata including the NWB file identifier, subject ID, age, sex, species, session description, session start time, lab, institution, and keywords."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook demonstrates loading several independent pieces of data from the NWB file:\n1. Trial information through nwb.trials.to_dataframe()\n2. Stimulus images from nwb.stimulus_template\n3. Electrode and unit information through nwb.electrodes.to_dataframe() and nwb.units.to_dataframe()\n4. Spike times for neural units\n\nThese represent at least three independent pieces of data loaded from the NWB file."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook visualizes several different types of data:\n1. Trial performance data (accuracy by memory load and by trial type)\n2. Response time distributions and averages\n3. Stimulus images (3x3 grid of images)\n4. Spike raster plots for neural units\n\nThese represent at least four independent visualizations of data from the NWB file."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "advanced-visualization",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook attempts to create advanced visualizations such as peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs) that would combine spike time data with trial event times, and also firing rate analysis that would combine unit activity with different memory load conditions. However, due to issues with unit selection/filtering, these visualizations don't actually produce results. While the code for advanced visualization is present, it doesn't execute successfully."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The plots that are successfully created (accuracy by memory load, accuracy by trial type, response time visualizations, stimulus images, and spike raster plots) are reasonably good quality. They include appropriate titles, axis labels, and in some cases additional annotations (like accuracy percentages on bars). The response time analysis includes multiple subplots to show different aspects of the data. The quality is reasonable but there are some issues with the plots as noted in the next section."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "There are several minor issues with the plots:\n1. The stimulus images are displayed rotated without explanation\n2. The spike raster plot has units labeled as \"unknown location\" due to an error in retrieving electrode locations\n3. The response time histograms by accuracy and trial type aren't very meaningful due to the extremely low number of incorrect trials\n4. Several planned visualizations don't execute due to issues with unit selection\n\nNone of these constitute major issues on their own, but together they represent multiple minor issues."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "analysis-issues",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "There are some significant issues with the analysis:\n1. The function that claims to return units per brain region is missing 14 units, possibly due to them being placed in bad channels\n2. The code fails to identify hippocampal and amygdala units despite earlier counts showing their presence, likely due to string matching issues\n3. Due to the unit selection failure, several planned analyses (comparison of hippocampus and amygdala units, analysis of memory load effects) cannot be performed\n\nThese represent at least one major issue (the unit selection failure that prevents multiple analyses) and other minor issues."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "The summary at the end lists several analyzed aspects that weren't successfully completed due to code errors, which could be considered minor unsupported conclusions. However, the notebook doesn't make strong claims about the results of these analyses - it just summarizes what was attempted. The notebook is generally cautious in its interpretations and emphasizes exploration over conclusions."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "The main other issue is that several tries/except blocks in the code mask underlying errors, making it difficult to understand why certain operations fail (particularly the unit selection). This is a minor issue as it doesn't fundamentally break the notebook's function but does reduce its educational value by hiding the real reasons for failures."
