    {
      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook does a very good job of describing the Dandiset. In Cell 3, it provides a comprehensive overview of Dandiset 000673, describing the experiment, recording methods (Macro-Micro Hybrid Depth Electrodes in medial temporal lobe and medial frontal cortex regions), focus on the hippocampus and amygdala, and the key research findings. It also provides a link to the Neurosift web interface for additional details and visualizations."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook demonstrates how to load information about the Dandiset very well. Cell 8 connects to the DANDI archive, retrieves Dandiset 000673, and lists the first five assets (NWB files) within the Dandiset. It prints the Dandiset ID, name, the total number of assets, and details about the first 5 assets. This provides a clear example of how to access Dandiset information."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook shows how to load basic information from an NWB file effectively. Cells 10-12 demonstrate opening a remote file using `remfile`, reading it into an NWB object using `pynwb`, and extracting basic metadata including the NWB file identifier, subject ID, age, sex, species, session description, and other details."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook shows how to load multiple pieces of data from an NWB file:\n1. Trial information (Cell 14)\n2. Stimulus images (Cell 21)\n3. Neural recordings/unit data (Cell 23)\n4. Electrode information (Cell 23)\n5. Spike times (Cell 25)\nThese constitute more than three independent pieces of data loaded from the NWB file."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook visualizes several pieces of data from the NWB file:\n1. Performance (accuracy) data by memory load (Cell 16)\n2. Performance (accuracy) data by trial type (Cell 17)\n3. Response time distributions and analyses (Cell 19)\n4. Stimulus images (Cell 21)\n5. Spike raster plot (Cell 25)\nWhile some of the visualizations had issues (rotated images, unknown electrode locations), the notebook still demonstrates visualization of multiple independent pieces of data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "advanced-visualization",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook attempts to create advanced visualizations involving multiple types of data, particularly in Cells 29, 32, and 35, which would have shown PSTHs relating neural activity to behavioral events. However, these visualizations failed due to issues with electrode location identification. The spike raster plot in Cell 25 and the response time analysis in Cell 19 are somewhat advanced but don't effectively combine multiple types of data from the NWB file. The visualizations that were successfully created were relatively basic rather than advanced."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The plots that were successfully generated (accuracy by memory load, accuracy by trial type, response time analyses, stimulus images, spike raster) are of reasonably good quality. They include proper labels, titles, and color coding. However, they are not exceptional in terms of design or information density, and some (like the spike raster) have labeling issues."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "There are a few issues with the plots:\n1. In Cell 21, the stimulus images are displayed rotated, which could be disorienting.\n2. In Cell 25, the electrode locations show up as \"unknown location\" due to an error that was masked by a try/except block.\n3. In Cell 19, the response time distribution by accuracy has limited interpretability due to the very low number of incorrect trials.\n\nThese are relatively minor issues that don't completely undermine the visualizations but do affect their interpretability."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-redundancy",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "There doesn't appear to be excessive redundancy between the plots in the notebook. Each visualization focuses on different aspects of the data or presents the same data from different perspectives that add value (e.g., accuracy by memory load vs. by trial type). The notebook avoids repetitive visualizations of the same data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "In the notebook, there don't appear to be unsupported conclusions. The text is generally descriptive of what is being shown in the visualizations, and when analyses fail (as in the case of the hippocampal and amygdala unit comparisons), this is explicitly stated. The notebook is appropriately cautious in its interpretations."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "There are some issues with the notebook:\n1. In Cell 23, the documentation of the function claims to return the number of units per brain region based on electrode locations, but it's missing 14 units.\n2. In Cell 31, the counts for hippocampus and amygdala units are 0, which is inconsistent with earlier output that showed units in these regions.\n3. Because of these issues, the later analyses (Cells 29, 32, 35) that depend on correctly identifying hippocampal and amygdala units fail.\n4. Cell 36 summarizes analyses that were not successfully completed due to code errors.\n\nThese are major issues that affect the functionality of the notebook and prevent some of the key analyses from being successfully completed."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "overall-effectiveness",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook is somewhat effective for getting started with loading and basic visualization of the Dandiset. It successfully demonstrates:\n1. How to connect to and load data from a Dandiset\n2. How to explore basic metadata from an NWB file\n3. How to access and display various data types (trials, stimuli, neural recordings)\n4. How to create simple visualizations of behavioral and neural data\n\nHowever, its effectiveness is limited by the issues with unit selection and the failure of more advanced analyses. The notebook would be more effective if these issues were resolved to complete the intended analyses. Given the balance of successful and unsuccessful elements, the notebook is somewhat effective overall."
