    {
      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook introduces Dandiset 001333, the Parkinson's Electrophysiological Signal Dataset (PESD), explaining that it contains electrophysiological signals from healthy and parkinsonian subjects with a focus on pathological biomarkers. This provides a good basic understanding of the dataset's purpose and content."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "Cell 3 demonstrates using the `dandi` package to connect to the DANDI Archive, retrieve Dandiset 001333, and list the first five assets (NWB files) within the Dandiset. This effectively shows how to programmatically access the dataset and get a glimpse of its contents."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "Cell 5 loads a specific NWB file from the Dandiset using its URL with `remfile`, `h5py`, and `pynwb`, then extracts and prints basic metadata (session description, experimenter, and keywords). This demonstrates how to load an NWB file and access its basic information."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook only demonstrates loading one piece of data from the NWB file - the LFP (Local Field Potential) data and its corresponding timestamps in Cell 7. No other independent pieces of data are loaded."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook only visualizes one piece of data - the LFP Beta Band Voltage over time in Cell 7. No other independent pieces of data are visualized."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "advanced-visualization",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook does not create any advanced visualizations involving multiple types of data. It only shows a basic time series plot of LFP data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The plot in Cell 7 has appropriate title, axis labels, and a legend. The description indicates the plot clearly shows the LFP Beta Band Voltage over time with proper formatting and labeling."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "No issues are reported with the plot in the critique. The plot appears to be well-formatted with proper labels and clearly visualizes the data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "analysis-issues",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The critique doesn't mention any issues with the analysis performed in the notebook. The notebook correctly extracts and visualizes LFP data from the NWB file."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The critique doesn't mention any unsupported conclusions drawn in the notebook. Cell 8 mentions potential further investigations but doesn't make unfounded claims about the data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "No other issues are reported in the critique. The notebook appears to be well-structured with clear section headers and appropriate explanations."
