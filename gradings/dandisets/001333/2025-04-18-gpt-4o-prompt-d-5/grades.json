    {
      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook introduces Dandiset 001333 which contains electrophysiological data from Parkinson's patients and control subjects. It mentions the focus on subthalamic nucleus (STN) signals, specifically Beta Average Rectified Voltage (ARV) and Local Field Potential (LFP). While it provides a basic description, it doesn't go into extensive detail about the dataset's content, purpose, or methodology."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook demonstrates loading the Dandiset well. It imports the necessary libraries (DandiAPIClient), connects to the DANDI archive, retrieves Dandiset 001333, fetches the assets, and displays the total number and paths of the first 5 assets. This provides a clear example of how to access a Dandiset."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook shows how to load an NWB file from the Dandiset using remfile, h5py, and pynwb. It extracts and displays basic metadata from the NWB file, including the session description, session start time, and experiment description. This demonstrates good basic information extraction from an NWB file."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook shows how to load one piece of data from the NWB file - specifically the 'Beta_Band_Voltage' data and its corresponding timestamps. It doesn't demonstrate loading any other independent data types from the file."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook visualizes one piece of data: the Beta Band Voltage over time. The visualization includes appropriate axis labels and a title. No other data types are visualized."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "advanced-visualization",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook does not create an advanced visualization that combines multiple types of data. It only shows a basic time series plot of Beta Band Voltage."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The plot created is of reasonably good quality. It has proper axis labels (Time (s) and Voltage (V)), a title (\"Beta Band Voltage Over Time\"), and includes a grid for better readability. The plot effectively displays the voltage fluctuations over time."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "There are no reported issues with the plot in the critique. The plot appears to be correctly formatted with appropriate labels and displays the data effectively."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "analysis-issues",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "There are no reported issues with the analysis in the critique. The notebook correctly loads and visualizes the data as intended, though the analysis is quite basic."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook does not appear to draw any unsupported conclusions. The final cell simply summarizes what was covered and suggests potential future directions for analysis."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "No other issues are reported in the critique. The notebook follows a logical flow, properly imports libraries, loads data, visualizes it, and closes connections to release resources."
