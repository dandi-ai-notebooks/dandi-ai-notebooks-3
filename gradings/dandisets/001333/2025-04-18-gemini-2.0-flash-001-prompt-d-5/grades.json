    {
      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook provides a good description of the Dandiset 001333, mentioning it's a Parkinson's Electrophysiological Signal Dataset (PESD) containing electrophysiological signals from Parkinson's and healthy subjects, Beta ARV, and LFP signals from the STN. It also provides a link to Neurosift for interactive exploration. This gives a clear understanding of what the dataset contains."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook effectively demonstrates loading the Dandiset using the DANDI API. It retrieves Dandiset 001333, lists assets (NWB files) within it, and shows the total count of assets and displays the paths of the first five assets. This clearly shows how to access and explore a Dandiset."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook shows how to load an NWB file from the URL using remfile, h5py, and pynwb. It extracts and displays basic metadata from the NWB file, including session_description, identifier, and session_start_time. This demonstrates competent handling of basic NWB file loading."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook loads LFP data (specifically Beta Band Voltage) from the NWB file, extracting both the lfp_data and lfp_timestamps. However, it only loads one type of data (LFP data), so it deserves a score of 1."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook visualizes the LFP data (Beta Band Voltage) as a time series plot with appropriate axis labels and title. However, it only visualizes one type of data, so it deserves a score of 1."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "advanced-visualization",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook does not create an advanced visualization involving multiple types of data. It only shows a basic time series plot of a single data type (LFP data)."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The plot shown is of reasonably good quality with appropriate axes labels, a title, and gridlines for better readability. The seaborn theme is applied for visual appeal."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "No issues with the plot were mentioned in the critique. The plot includes appropriate labels, title, and styling."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "analysis-issues",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "No issues with the analysis were mentioned in the critique. The notebook correctly loads and visualizes the data, though the analysis is relatively basic."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook mentions that the LFP data shows oscillatory behavior typical for beta band voltage, which appears to be a reasonable observation based on the visualization. The notebook also proposes potential future research directions without making unsupported claims."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "No other issues were mentioned in the critique. The notebook includes a disclaimer about being AI-generated, which is a responsible approach."
