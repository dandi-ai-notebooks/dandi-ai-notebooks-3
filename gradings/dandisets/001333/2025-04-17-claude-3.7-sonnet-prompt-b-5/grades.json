    {
      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook provides a good description of the Dandiset (001333), identifying it as the Parkinson's Electrophysiological Signal Dataset (PESD). It explains that the dataset contains two types of signals (Beta ARV and STN LFP) and describes the expected characteristics of parkinsonian signals. It also provides the Dandiset ID, name, description, and analyzes the structure of the dataset including subject categories and file types. This gives a reasonably complete picture of what the Dandiset contains."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook successfully connects to the DANDI archive using DandiAPIClient, retrieves the Dandiset with ID \"001333\", extracts its metadata, and lists the assets it contains. It also analyzes the structure of the Dandiset by examining the file paths to identify subject categories and file extensions. This provides a good demonstration of how to load information about a Dandiset."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook defines a function to load NWB files from a URL and uses it to load an NWB file from the Dandiset. It then accesses and prints various metadata attributes including session description, start time, lab, institution, experiment description, keywords, and subject information. It also explores the processing modules, data interfaces, and electrode information in the NWB file. This provides a very comprehensive look at how to access information from an NWB file."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook loads several pieces of data from the NWB file:\n1. Beta Band Voltage data and corresponding timestamps from the LFP electrical series\n2. Electrode information from the NWB file\n3. Through the defined functions, it loads additional data for frequency analysis\nIt also attempts to load data from a second NWB file for comparison (though it appears to load the same file accidentally)."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook visualizes multiple pieces of data from the NWB file:\n1. Time series plot of Beta Band Voltage data\n2. Frequency spectrum plot with highlighted beta band\n3. Spectrogram showing time-frequency representation with beta band marked\n4. Bar chart comparing power in different frequency bands\n5. Plot showing sliding window beta and theta band power over time\n6. Comparative plots of two sessions (though they appear to be identical)\nThis demonstrates a variety of ways to visualize NWB data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "advanced-visualization",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook creates several advanced visualizations that combine multiple types of data:\n1. The spectrogram with beta band markers combines time and frequency domain information\n2. The sliding window band power analysis combines temporal and spectral information\n3. The comparative plots in Cell 46 show multiple sessions and representations side by side\nThese visualizations go beyond simple plots of raw data and integrate multiple data aspects."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The plots in the notebook are generally well-made with proper titles, axis labels, and annotations. The spectrogram includes helpful marker lines for the beta band, the frequency spectrum plot highlights the relevant frequency range, and the comparative plots effectively show differences (or lack thereof) between sessions. The plots use appropriate scales (e.g., logarithmic for power spectra) and include legends where needed."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "There are several minor issues with the plots:\n1. The time axis doesn't start from zero, which could be addressed by subtracting the initial timestamp\n2. The y-axis lacks units in some plots\n3. Time alignment issues between different plots\n4. The spectrogram's frequency resolution may be limited\nNone of these are major issues that completely invalidate the plots, but they do affect the interpretability."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "analysis-issues",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "The analysis has some significant issues:\n1. The band power calculation is not energy-preserving as it doesn't account for frequency resolution\n2. The comparison between sessions is ineffective because the same file was loaded twice\n3. The sampling frequency from the first session is reused for the second session without verification\nThe issue with comparing identical sessions is particularly problematic as it invalidates a key part of the analysis."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "There are some unsupported conclusions in the summary:\n1. The claim that comparing two sessions revealed consistent beta band activity is invalid since the same file was loaded twice\n2. The statement that lower frequencies generally have higher power is contradicted by the data showing gamma with the highest power\nThese represent major unsupported conclusions that affect the interpretation of the results."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "There is a potential resource management issue: after loading the second NWB file, the h5_file object is not explicitly closed, which might lead to memory leaks due to remfile not automatically closing the underlying HTTP connection. This is a minor technical issue that doesn't affect the analysis but could cause problems when processing many files."
