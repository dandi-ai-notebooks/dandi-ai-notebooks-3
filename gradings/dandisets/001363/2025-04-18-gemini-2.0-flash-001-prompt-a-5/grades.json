    {
      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook provides a good description of the Dandiset 001363 in cell 3, mentioning the type of data (neural spiking in rat somatosensory cortex), the experimental paradigm (focused ultrasound), and key variables (pressure and duty cycles). It also includes links to the Dandiset on DANDI Archive and Neurosift visualization. This sets appropriate context for the analysis."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "Cell 6 demonstrates connecting to the DANDI archive, retrieving Dandiset 001363, and listing the first 5 assets within the Dandiset using the dandiapi library. The output shows 55 assets found. This effectively shows how to load information about the Dandiset."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "Cell 8 shows how to load a specific NWB file from the DANDI archive using remfile and h5py. The notebook extracts and displays key metadata attributes such as session description, identifier, session start time, institution, and subject ID, providing good context for understanding the experiment."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook demonstrates loading only one piece of data: electrophysiology data (ElectricalSeries) in cell 10, and displays trial information in cell 12. While the trials table is accessed, this is metadata rather than a second independent piece of data. No other data types are loaded."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook only visualizes one piece of data: the electrophysiology data from 32 channels in cell 10. No other visualizations of different data types are shown."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "advanced-visualization",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook does not create any advanced visualizations that combine multiple types of data. The only visualization is a basic line plot of the electrophysiology data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "There is only one plot in the notebook (cell 10) showing electrophysiology data. The plot has appropriate axes and appears to be reasonably good quality, but it's a basic line plot without additional features like legends, titles, or annotations that would make it very high quality."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The single plot in the notebook doesn't have any identified issues. It correctly shows the voltage fluctuations over time for 32 channels."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-redundancy",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "There is only one plot in the notebook, so there cannot be any redundancy between plots."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook doesn't make any unsupported conclusions. Cell 13 suggests future analysis directions but doesn't draw specific conclusions from the data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "No other issues are identified in the critique. The notebook functions as intended, although it's relatively limited in scope."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "overall-effectiveness",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook is somewhat effective at introducing the Dandiset and demonstrating basic loading of NWB files and data visualization. It clearly describes the Dandiset, successfully loads an NWB file and displays metadata, and shows basic visualization of electrophysiology data. However, it's limited in scope - only one type of data is loaded and visualized, there are no advanced visualizations, and the analysis is quite basic. The notebook would be more effective if it loaded and visualized additional data types and provided more sophisticated analyses."
