    {
      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook provides a good description of the Dandiset in cell 3, describing the type of data (neural spiking in rat somatosensory cortex), the experimental paradigm (focused ultrasound), and key variables. It also includes links to the Dandiset and Neurosift visualization. This effectively sets the context for the analysis."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "Cell 6 shows how to connect to the DANDI archive, retrieve Dandiset 001363, and list the first 5 assets within the Dandiset using the dandiapi library. This demonstrates good practices for loading information about the Dandiset."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "Cell 8 loads the specified NWB file from the DANDI archive using remfile and h5py, then extracts and prints key metadata attributes such as session description, identifier, session start time, institution, and subject ID. This effectively demonstrates how to access basic information from an NWB file."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook loads two independent pieces of data: electrophysiology data (ElectricalSeries) in cell 10 and trials data in cell 12. These represent different types of information from the NWB file."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook only visualizes one piece of data - the electrophysiology time series in cell 10. The trials data is only displayed as a table but not visualized graphically."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "advanced-visualization",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook does not create any advanced visualizations involving multiple types of data. The only visualization is a basic time series plot of the electrophysiology data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The one plot shown (electrophysiology data in cell 10) appears to be of reasonable quality. It shows voltage fluctuations over time for 32 channels and has appropriate axes labels (time in seconds, voltage in Volts)."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "There are no reported issues with the plot. The critique describes it as a line plot showing electrophysiology data with appropriate axes and content."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "analysis-issues",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "No issues with the analysis are reported in the critique. The notebook correctly loads and displays the data types it works with."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The critique doesn't indicate that any unsupported conclusions were drawn in the notebook. Cell 13 simply summarizes what was accomplished and suggests possible directions for future analysis without making claims about the data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "No other issues are reported in the critique. The notebook appears to be well-structured with clear introductions to each section and appropriate code for the tasks performed."
