  "prompt_version": "4",
  "grades": [
    {
      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook provides a clear title with the Dandiset ID (001363), explains that it contains neural spiking data from rat somatosensory cortex, and includes details about the flexible electrode and transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) used in the study. It also provides a link to the Dandiset on neurosift.app. This gives a reasonably complete picture of what the Dandiset contains."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook uses the dandiapi library to connect to the DANDI archive, retrieve the Dandiset, and list its assets. It prints the total number of assets and paths of the first five assets. This demonstrates basic functionality for accessing the Dandiset information."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook loads an NWB file from a URL using pynwb, h5py, and remfile. It retrieves and displays key metadata including session description, identifier, session start time, and institution. This shows a reasonable approach to loading basic information from an NWB file."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook loads two independent pieces of data: (1) electrode information from nwb.electrodes, and (2) trial information from nwb.intervals['trials']. Both are converted to pandas DataFrames for further analysis."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook visualizes two independent pieces of data: (1) electrode locations using a scatter plot, and (2) trial durations using a histogram. However, the trial duration visualization has significant issues with empty bins and incorrect x-axis scaling."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "advanced-visualization",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook does not create any advanced visualizations that combine multiple types of data from the NWB file. The visualizations shown are basic single-variable plots."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The electrode location plot has appropriate axis labels with units, but the trial duration histogram is completely flawed with an empty plot and x-axis in scientific notation with extremely large exponents. Overall, the plot quality is poor."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "There is at least one major issue with the plots: the trial duration histogram is empty with extremely large x-axis values (1e12+), indicating a serious error in the calculation of trial durations. Additionally, there's a minor issue with the electrode plot where the units (microns) are used without verification that the data is actually in that unit."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-redundancy",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "There are only two plots in the notebook, and they visualize different aspects of the data (electrode locations and trial durations). There is no redundancy between these plots."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "The notebook makes at least one major unsupported conclusion. It incorrectly states that all trials have a duration of 1.5 seconds based on a clearly flawed histogram that shows no data and has an x-axis with extremely large values."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "There are a few minor issues: (1) The specified NWB filename doesn't appear in the listing of the first five assets shown earlier, which could cause confusion; (2) The notebook doesn't suppress or explain UserWarnings that appear when loading the NWB file; (3) The summary at the end doesn't acknowledge the limitations or issues encountered during analysis."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "overall-effectiveness",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "The notebook demonstrates basic loading of a Dandiset and NWB file, and includes some visualization attempts. However, the significant issues with the trial duration analysis and resulting incorrect conclusions significantly reduce its effectiveness. It provides only a very basic introduction to working with the data, and the serious error in the analysis would mislead rather than help users."
