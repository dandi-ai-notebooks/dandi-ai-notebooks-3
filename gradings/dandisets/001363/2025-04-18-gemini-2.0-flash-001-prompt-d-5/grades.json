    {
      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook introduces the Dandiset (001363) in the title and provides additional details about the dataset in cell 3, including mentioning that it contains neural spiking data from rat somatosensory cortex using a flexible electrode responding to transcranial focused ultrasound. It includes a link to the Dandiset for further information. This is a reasonably good description but could be more comprehensive."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "Cell 5 demonstrates how to access the DANDI API, retrieve the specific Dandiset, and list its assets. It shows the total number of assets and displays the first five asset paths. This provides a clear example of how to load information about the Dandiset using the appropriate libraries."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "Cell 7 shows how to load an NWB file from the Dandiset using pynwb, h5py, and remfile. It retrieves the file from a URL and extracts basic metadata like session description, identifier, session start time, and institution. Despite the warnings that could have been suppressed, the loading process is demonstrated clearly."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook shows loading of electrode location data from the NWB file in cell 9 and trial timing information in cell 12. These represent two independent pieces of data loaded from the NWB file, even though there are issues with how the trial durations were calculated."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook visualizes electrode locations in cell 9 using a scatter plot. In cell 12, it attempts to visualize trial durations using a histogram, though this visualization is problematic due to calculation errors. These represent two attempts at visualizing different types of data, though one is flawed."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "advanced-visualization",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook does not create any advanced visualizations that combine multiple types of data. Both visualizations (electrode locations and trial durations) are simple, single-data-type plots, and one of them has significant issues."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The electrode location plot has appropriate axis labels with units, but there's uncertainty about the correctness of the units. The trial duration histogram has serious issues with the x-axis scaling, making it essentially unreadable and invalid. Overall, the plot quality is poor."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": -3,
      "thinking": "There are significant issues with the plots: 1) The trial duration histogram is completely empty with extreme x-axis values due to calculation errors, and 2) The electrode location plot has potentially misleading axis units without verification. These represent at least two major issues."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "analysis-issues",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "There's a major issue in the analysis of trial durations, where the calculation method produced invalid results (values in the 1e12+ range). This led to an empty histogram and incorrect conclusions about all trials lasting 1.5 seconds. This represents a fundamental analysis error."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "Cell 13 draws a completely unsupported conclusion that all trials have a duration of 1.5 seconds, when the data shown in the previous cell clearly contradicts this (with values on the order of 1e12+ seconds). This is a major unsupported conclusion that undermines the analysis."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "The notebook references a specific NWB file in cell 6 that isn't shown in the first five assets listed in cell 5, which could potentially cause confusion. There are also unsuppressed warnings in cell 7 that could be distracting. These represent minor issues rather than major ones."
