      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook provides a good description of the Dandiset 001195. Cells 3, 9, 11, and 12 describe the Dandiset's content, purpose, and data types (electrophysiology and calcium imaging). It explains that the data involves recordings from the Dorsal Raphe Nucleus and Central Amygdala in the context of studying loneliness-like states. The notebook extracts and displays metadata including keywords, anatomical regions, and measurement techniques. However, some metadata sections report \"not available\" even though the information might exist. Overall, the description is reasonably thorough but could be more comprehensive."

    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook demonstrates how to load information about the Dandiset very well. In cells 7-11, it connects to the DANDI Archive using the dandi package, retrieves the Dandiset with ID \"001195\", and extracts metadata including the name, URL, description, keywords, anatomical regions, and measurement techniques. It also lists and categorizes the assets (files) in the Dandiset, separating them into electrophysiology and calcium imaging categories, and displaying their file sizes. The approach is comprehensive and well-structured."

    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook effectively demonstrates loading basic information from NWB files in the Dandiset. It loads both an electrophysiology NWB file (cells 14-16) and a calcium imaging NWB file (cells 29-33), extracting and displaying extensive metadata from both. The code shows how to access session details, subject information, experimenter information, and other relevant metadata. For the calcium imaging file, it also extracts information about the imaging plane, processed ROIs, frame rate, image dimensions, etc. The notebook uses appropriate error handling and clearly explains the loading process."

    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook demonstrates loading multiple pieces of data from NWB files:\n1. Electrophysiology data: It loads membrane potential responses and stimulus current injections (cells 20-24).\n2. It extracts steady-state membrane potential values for I-V curve analysis (cell 26).\n3. Calcium imaging data: It loads imaging frames (cell 35).\n4. It extracts fluorescence traces (F) and corresponding time vectors (cells 37-38).\n5. It calculates mean fluorescence activity across ROIs (cell 40).\nThese represent at least three independent types of data loaded from the NWB files."

      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook visualizes multiple pieces of data from NWB files:\n1. It plots membrane potential responses to current injections for different stimulus intensities (cells 22-24).\n2. It visualizes the current-voltage (I-V) relationship (cell 26).\n3. It displays a sample calcium imaging frame (cell 35).\n4. It plots fluorescence traces for selected ROIs (cell 38).\n5. It visualizes the mean fluorescence activity over time (cell 40).\n6. It generates a heatmap of calcium activity across all ROIs (cell 42).\nThese represent at least three independent visualizations of data from the NWB files."

    {
      "question_id": "advanced-visualization",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook includes some visualizations that combine different types of data, such as plotting both membrane potential responses and stimulus currents in the same figure (cells 22-24), and generating a heatmap of calcium activity across all ROIs over time (cell 42). However, these visualizations are relatively standard and don't represent truly advanced visualizations that integrate multiple data types in novel or sophisticated ways. There's no visualization that, for example, combines calcium imaging with electrophysiology data or correlates neuronal activity with behavioral measures."

    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The plots in the notebook have significant issues with quality. The membrane potential plots have nonsensical y-axis values (on the order of 1e13-1e14 mV) due to unit conversion errors. The current-voltage plot has similar scaling issues. The calcium imaging visualizations are better but lack proper normalization (delta F/F0) and could benefit from smoothing to reduce noise. The calcium activity heatmap is reasonably effective but lacks spatial context. While the plots do convey some information, their quality is compromised by these technical issues."

    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": -3,
      "thinking": "The notebook has major issues with plots:\n1. Critical unit conversion errors in the membrane potential plots, showing values on the order of 1e13-1e14 mV (cells 22-24).\n2. Similar scaling issues in the current-voltage plot (cell 26).\n3. No proper normalization (delta F/F0) for calcium imaging data (cells 38-42).\n4. Lack of stimulus period labels on plots to contextualize neural activity.\n5. High noise levels in calcium trace plots without appropriate filtering.\nThese represent at least two major issues affecting plot interpretation and accuracy."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "analysis-issues",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "The notebook has several analysis issues:\n1. The unit conversion for membrane potential is critically flawed, affecting all electrophysiology analysis.\n2. The method for excluding action potentials in the I-V curve analysis (cell 26) relies on a hardcoded threshold without justification.\n3. The calcium imaging analysis lacks standard normalization methods (delta F/F0).\n4. The action potential detection method (using np.any(response_mV > 0)) is overly simplistic and prone to false positives.\n5. The selection of steady-state periods for analysis is inconsistent and lacks justification.\nThese represent at least two major issues that significantly impact the validity of the analyses."

    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook is generally cautious about drawing conclusions. It focuses primarily on demonstrating data loading and visualization rather than making specific claims about the neuronal properties or activity patterns. The summary in cell 43 highlights what was demonstrated rather than making unsupported interpretations. Similarly, the future directions in cell 44 suggest analyses that could be performed rather than drawing premature conclusions. The notebook appropriately acknowledges its AI-generated nature and potential for errors. No significant unsupported conclusions are evident."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "There are some other minor issues with the notebook:\n1. Inconsistency in how steady-state periods are defined between different analyses.\n2. Limited explanation of the biological significance of the data being analyzed.\n3. Lack of context for how the different data types (electrophysiology and calcium imaging) relate to each other.\n4. Some hardcoded values without clear explanation (e.g., indices 4, 10, 16 for stimulus intensities).\n5. The measurement techniques section reports information as \"not available\" when keywords suggest such information exists.\nThese are relatively minor issues that don't significantly detract from the notebook's overall purpose."
