  "prompt_version": "4",
  "grades": [
    {
      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "Cells 3 and 4 provide a thorough description of the Dandiset, explaining the experimental setup (CANCAN technique), parameters varied (burst numbers), methods used (Hoechst and YoPro-1 staining), and providing a direct link to the Dandiset. The description is detailed and gives readers a clear understanding of the dataset's content and purpose."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "Cells 8-10 demonstrate how to connect to the DANDI archive, retrieve the Dandiset, list assets, and examine file sizes by subject/condition. The notebook uses the dandi package effectively to interact with the API and provides clear output showing the assets available. This gives users a comprehensive understanding of how to access and explore the Dandiset."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "Cells 12-16 show how to load an NWB file from the Dandiset using remfile, h5py, and pynwb. The notebook demonstrates how to access and print various metadata attributes including session description, file identifier, session start time, experimenters, lab, institution, and subject information. It also shows how to iterate through acquisition data to identify ImageSeries objects and print their properties."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook loads multiple independent pieces of data from NWB files: 1) Image data from the first NWB file in Cell 18, 2) Image data from a second NWB file in Cell 28/30, and 3) Metadata from both files. The notebook effectively demonstrates loading different types of data from multiple NWB files in the Dandiset."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook provides multiple independent visualizations: 1) Central region of the first image (Cell 20), 2) Intensity profiles across horizontal and vertical cross-sections (Cell 22), 3) Comparison of five different regions of the image (Cell 24), 4) Bar plot of average intensities by region (Cell 26), 5) Side-by-side comparison of central regions from two different conditions (Cell 30), 6) Intensity histograms for comparison (Cell 32), and 7) Radial intensity profiles (Cell 34). This demonstrates a comprehensive approach to visualizing the data in different ways."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "advanced-visualization",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook includes several advanced visualizations that combine multiple types of data: 1) Cell 22 shows the image with horizontal and vertical cross-sections highlighted, along with their corresponding intensity profiles; 2) Cell 24 divides the image into regions and displays them with their statistical properties; 3) Cell 34 computes and visualizes radial intensity profiles from the center of the image for two different conditions. These visualizations effectively combine spatial and intensity information to provide deeper insights."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The plots in the notebook are of high quality. The code sets up plotting parameters with sns.set_theme() and adjusts plt.rcParams for consistent style. The visualizations include appropriate titles, axis labels, colorbars for images, and legends where applicable. Contrast stretching is applied to enhance image features. The plots effectively communicate the data and findings."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "No issues were identified with the plots in the notebook. All plots have appropriate titles, labels, and legends. Color schemes are consistent and effective. The images have colorbars for reference. There are no apparent errors or misrepresentations in the visualizations."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-redundancy",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "There is no excessive redundancy between plots. While some plots visualize the same data (e.g., the central region of the images), they do so in different ways or for different purposes (e.g., direct visualization vs. regional comparison vs. side-by-side condition comparison). Each plot contributes unique insights to understanding the data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook does not make unsupported conclusions. It describes what is observed in the data but avoids making definitive claims about the experimental results. The cell commentary and final summary accurately reflect what was demonstrated in the notebook without overinterpreting the findings."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "No other significant issues were identified in the notebook. The code executes properly, the visualizations are effective, and the commentary accurately describes the steps and findings. The notebook includes appropriate disclaimers about its AI-generated nature."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "overall-effectiveness",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "This notebook is very effective for getting started with loading, visualizing, and analyzing this Dandiset. It provides a clear introduction to the dataset, demonstrates multiple ways to load and access the data, and showcases a variety of visualization techniques. The progression from basic to more complex analyses is logical and builds understanding. The notebook effectively compares data across conditions and suggests meaningful directions for further analysis. The code is well-structured, well-commented, and produces high-quality visualizations that illuminate the data's key features."
