    {
      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook provides a brief description of Dandiset 001276 in Cell 3, explaining the experiment's focus on variations in burst numbers during NG-CANCAN Remote Targeting Electroporation and their effect on cell monolayer permeabilization. It also provides a link to the Dandiset in Cell 4. While the description is present and reasonable, it could have been more detailed with information about the experimental design, importance of the research, or broader context."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "Cell 8 demonstrates how to load information about the Dandiset using the dandiapi client. It retrieves the Dandiset, lists its assets, and displays the number of assets and paths of the first five assets. This is a reasonable demonstration of loading Dandiset information."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "Cell 9 and 10 show the process of loading a specific NWB file from the Dandiset. The notebook constructs the URL for downloading the asset and then uses pynwb, h5py, and remfile to open and read the file. It attempts to display metadata attributes like session_description, identifier, session_start_time, etc., though there's an issue where only the last attribute is displayed. Despite this minor issue, the notebook demonstrates the basic process of loading an NWB file."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook only demonstrates loading one piece of data from the NWB file in Cell 12, which is a subset of image data from SingleTimePointImaging. No other data types are loaded from the NWB file."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook only visualizes one piece of data in Cell 12, which is a grayscale image of a 100x100 pixel section from the first frame of the SingleTimePointImaging data. No other visualizations of different data types are provided."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "advanced-visualization",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook does not create any advanced visualizations involving multiple types of data. It only provides a basic grayscale visualization of a single image frame."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The single plot shown in Cell 12 appears to be of reasonable quality, with a colorbar included to help interpret the grayscale values. However, the plot is basic and there's only one of them."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "There are no significant issues mentioned with the plot in Cell 12. The image is properly displayed with a colorbar, and there are no mentioned problems with axis labels, titles, or legibility."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "analysis-issues",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "There isn't much analysis performed in this notebook beyond loading and displaying a single image. There are no analytical operations being performed on the data, so there aren't really any analysis issues to identify."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook doesn't draw any conclusions from the data. Cell 13 suggests potential next steps for analysis but doesn't make any claims about the data itself."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "There is one minor issue mentioned in Cell 10 where there's a warning about conflicting namespace versions, and only the last attribute is displayed in the output instead of all the attributes. This is a minor issue that doesn't significantly impact the notebook's functionality."
