    {
      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook provides a good description of the Dandiset in cells 1 and 2, mentioning the Dandiset ID, the study name (NG-CANCAN Remote Targeting Electroporation), and the experimental design involving burst number variation on permeabilization distribution across cell monolayers. It explains the focus of the research (optimizing the CANCAN protocol) and provides a link to the Dandiset. This is reasonably comprehensive."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "Cell 6 demonstrates how to use the DANDI API to connect to the archive, retrieve the Dandiset with ID \"001276\", and list the assets within that Dandiset. It also prints the number of assets and the paths of the first five assets. This shows the basic functionality needed to access the Dandiset information."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "Cell 8 shows how to load a specific NWB file from a URL using `remfile` and `h5py`, and then access the 'SingleTimePointImaging' data within the NWB file using `pynwb`. This demonstrates the basic steps to access NWB file information."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "Based on the critique, the notebook shows loading of SingleTimePointImaging data from an NWB file in cell 8. However, it only appears to load one piece of data (the imaging data), not multiple independent pieces of data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook visualizes the SingleTimePointImaging data as a heatmap in cell 8, but doesn't appear to visualize any other pieces of data from the NWB file based on the critique provided."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "advanced-visualization",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The visualization shown in cell 8 is a basic heatmap of a single data type (imaging data). There is no indication of an advanced visualization involving multiple types of data from the NWB file."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The plot described in cell 8 appears to be a reasonable heatmap with proper axes, title, and colorbar showing intensity. The critique doesn't mention any specific quality issues with the plot."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "No specific issues with the plots are mentioned in the critique. The heatmap in cell 8 appears to be properly labeled with axes, title, and colorbar."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "analysis-issues",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook performs minimal analysis (just loading and visualizing data) and no specific analysis issues are mentioned in the critique."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The critique doesn't mention any unsupported conclusions in the notebook. Cell 9 acknowledges the visualization of intensity variations but doesn't appear to make any specific claims beyond what is directly observed."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "No other issues are mentioned in the critique. The notebook appears to flow logically from introduction to loading data to visualization, and includes necessary imports and documentation."
