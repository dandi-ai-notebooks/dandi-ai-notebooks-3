      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook introduces Dandiset 000945 in its first cell, describing the experiment (tFUS stimulation in rats) and outlining the dataset contents. Later cells provide context about the structure of the dataset, mentioning multiple rat subjects and different pulse repetition frequency (PRF) settings. It identifies specific files being analyzed. While the description is good, it could be more comprehensive regarding the overall experimental design."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "Cell 5 effectively uses the dandiapi library to connect to the DANDI archive, retrieve the Dandiset, and list the first five assets. The notebook also provides context about the structure of the files in the Dandiset. This is done reasonably well."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "Cell 7 loads an NWB file using remfile and pynwb, then prints basic information about it (subject ID, session description, species). Later, the notebook examines electrode setup and units (neurons), extracts trial information, and loads a second NWB file with different parameters. The notebook demonstrates good competency in loading and accessing basic NWB file information."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook loads multiple pieces of data from the NWB files: 1) electrode information (Cell 9), 2) unit (neuron) information (Cell 9), 3) trial timing information (Cell 11), 4) spike times data (Cells 13, 15, 17), and 5) data from a second NWB file with a different PRF (Cell 19). This demonstrates loading more than three independent pieces of data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook visualizes: 1) trial start times (Cell 11), 2) spike counts by unit and cell type (Cell 13), 3) spike raster plots for selected units (Cell 15), 4) PSTHs for individual units (Cell 17), 5) average PSTHs for different cell types and PRF conditions (Cell 21), and 6) response modulation bar plots (Cell 23). This demonstrates visualizing more than three independent pieces of data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The plots are functional but have several issues. The trial start time plot could be improved by zooming in to show jitter. The bar plot of spike counts has x-axis labels that are difficult to read. The raster plots and PSTHs incorrectly mark stimulus offset. The response modulation plot doesn't clearly distinguish between cell types. While the plots serve their basic purpose, they have notable room for improvement."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "There are major issues with the plots: 1) The \"Stimulus Offset\" line is consistently placed at 2 seconds when it should be at 0.067 seconds based on the stated 67ms ultrasound duration. This is a fundamental misrepresentation that affects the interpretation of neural responses. 2) The cell-type identifiers (1.0 and 2.0) are not clearly explained. 3) The analysis windows for response quantification are questionable given the actual stimulus duration. 4) Some plots have poor axis scaling that obscures potential differences."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "analysis-issues",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "Major analysis issues include: 1) The use of inappropriate time windows for response analysis that don't align with the stated 67ms stimulus duration. 2) Analysis of only a subset of units without proper justification. 3) Inappropriate binning for PSTHs given the short stimulus duration (bin size may be too large to capture transient responses). 4) The statistically non-significant results are not properly acknowledged in subsequent interpretation."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "Major unsupported conclusions include: 1) The statement that \"Some units show changes in firing rate in response to the stimulus onset or offset\" when the PSTHs don't visually demonstrate this. 2) Claims about differences in how cell types respond to PRFs when no statistical significance was found. 3) Stating the stimulation lasted 2.2 seconds when documentation indicated it was 67ms. These are fundamental misrepresentations of the results."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "Other minor issues include: 1) The overlap between trial duration and inter-trial interval is not explained. 2) The analysis is limited to only two PRF conditions without acknowledging this limitation. 3) There's inconsistency in which subset of units is used for different analyses. These are minor compared to the more significant problems with the plots and analysis."
