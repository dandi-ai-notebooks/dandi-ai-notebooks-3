    {
      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook does a reasonable job of describing the Dandiset. It introduces Dandiset 000945, explains that it contains tFUS stimulation data in rats, and provides some context about the experiment including the stimulation parameters. The description is present in the first cell of the notebook and sets up the goals of the analysis. However, it could have provided more details about the experimental design and the significance of this data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook demonstrates how to load information about the Dandiset well. It uses the dandiapi library to connect to the DANDI archive, retrieves Dandiset 000945, and lists the assets within the dataset. Cell 5 specifically shows this process and outputs the number of assets found and their file paths. The notebook also explains the structure of the files in the Dandiset in Cell 6."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook shows how to load basic information from an NWB file in the Dandiset very well. In Cell 7, it defines the URL for a specific NWB file, loads it using remfile and pynwb, and prints basic information such as subject ID, session description, and species. Later, in Cell 19, it loads a second NWB file with a different pulse repetition frequency for comparison. The code is clear and the process is well explained."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook loads multiple pieces of data from the NWB files. It extracts:\n1. Electrode and unit information (Cell 9)\n2. Trial structure information (Cell 11)\n3. Spike times for units (Cell 13, 15, 17)\n4. Data from a second NWB file with different PRF (Cell 19)\nThe notebook therefore loads more than three independent pieces of data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook visualizes multiple pieces of data from the NWB files:\n1. Trial start times (Cell 11)\n2. Spike counts by unit and cell type (Cell 13)\n3. Raster plots of spike times aligned to trial onsets (Cell 15)\n4. PSTHs for individual units (Cell 17)\n5. Average PSTHs for each cell type under different PRF conditions (Cell 21)\n6. Response ratio comparison between PRFs (Cell 23)\nThese visualizations cover a wide range of the loaded data, well beyond three independent pieces."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "advanced-visualization",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook creates several advanced visualizations that combine multiple types of data:\n1. Cell 15 creates raster plots that combine spike times with trial information\n2. Cell 17 creates PSTHs that integrate spike times across trials\n3. Cell 21 creates average PSTHs that compare responses across different PRF conditions and cell types\n4. Cell 23 creates a grouped bar plot comparing response ratios between different PRFs and includes statistical significance indicators\n\nHowever, there are issues with the visualizations, particularly with the incorrect placement of the stimulus offset line and questionable analysis windows. Despite these issues, the notebook does show advanced visualizations combining multiple data types."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The plots in the notebook are reasonably good quality but have several issues. The plots include appropriate titles, axis labels, and legends. However, there are some problems:\n1. In Cell 13, the unit IDs on the x-axis are difficult to read\n2. In Cells 15, 17, and 21, the stimulus offset line is incorrectly placed at 2 seconds instead of 67ms\n3. Some plots would benefit from improved visualization choices (e.g., using distributions rather than individual bars for the large number of units)\n\nDue to these issues, the plot quality is only reasonably good, not very good."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "The notebook has several major issues with plots:\n1. Stimulus offset line is consistently incorrect (placed at 2 seconds instead of 67ms) in multiple plots, which is a major misrepresentation of the experimental design\n2. The x-axis in the spike counts plot (Cell 13) is difficult to read due to angle and density\n3. The analysis windows chosen for the statistical comparisons (Cell 23) are questionable given the actual stimulus duration\n4. The PSTH bin size (Cell 17) might be too large to capture transient responses given the brief stimulus duration\n\nThese are major issues as they could lead to incorrect interpretations of the data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "analysis-issues",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "The notebook has several major issues with the analysis:\n1. Incorrect representation of stimulus duration throughout the analysis (2 seconds vs 67ms)\n2. The analysis windows in Cell 23 (baseline: -0.9 to -0.1s, response: 0.1 to 0.9s) do not align with the actual timing of the stimulus (67ms duration)\n3. The bin size for PSTHs may be too large to capture transient responses\n4. The conclusions drawn about cell type differences in response to different PRFs are not supported by the statistical analysis, which showed no significant differences\n\nThese are major issues that affect the validity of the analysis and conclusions."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": -3,
      "thinking": "The notebook draws several unsupported conclusions:\n1. In Cell 18, it states \"Some units show changes in firing rate in response to the stimulus onset or offset, while others show less pronounced responses\" when the PSTHs do not visually demonstrate clear changes\n2. In Cell 24 (summary), it incorrectly states that stimulation lasted approximately 2.2 seconds instead of 67ms\n3. In Cell 24, it claims \"some units showing clear changes in firing rate in response to stimulus onset or offset\" when the visualizations don't support this\n4. In Cell 24, it states cell types may respond differently to PRFs with specific claims about each cell type, but these differences were not statistically significant\n\nThese constitute multiple major unsupported conclusions."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "There are some other minor issues with the notebook:\n1. The meaning of cell type labels (1.0 and 2.0) is not explained\n2. There's a discrepancy between the stated trial duration (2.5s with 10% jitter) and the calculated mean trial duration (2.2s)\n3. The analysis is limited to a subset of units for computational efficiency, which limits the generalizability of the findings, but this limitation is not explicitly acknowledged\n4. The cell types are sometimes not balanced in visualizations (e.g., only type 2.0 units shown in some PSTHs)\n\nThese appear to be relatively minor issues that don't fundamentally undermine the notebook's ability to introduce the dataset and demonstrate basic analysis techniques."
