    {
      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook appears to introduce Dandiset 000945 adequately. It provides a brief description of the experiment (tFUS stimulation in rats), outlines the contents of the dataset, and explains the goals of the notebook. The introduction is clear and provides context for the analyses that follow."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook demonstrates how to load information about the Dandiset using the dandiapi library. It connects to the DANDI archive, retrieves the specific Dandiset (000945), and lists the first five assets (NWB files) within the dataset. The code also provides output showing the number of assets found and their file paths."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook shows how to load a specific NWB file from the Dandiset using remfile and pynwb. It extracts and displays basic information about the NWB file, such as subject ID, session description, and species. The code also loads electrode and unit information, converting them to pandas DataFrames for easier analysis."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook demonstrates loading multiple pieces of data from the NWB files:\n1. Electrode information (coordinates, impedance, location)\n2. Unit (neuron) information including cell types\n3. Trial information and timing\n4. Spike times for multiple units\n5. Data from two different NWB files (with different PRFs: 3000 Hz and 1500 Hz)\nThis goes beyond the minimum requirement of three independent pieces of data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook visualizes several types of data from the NWB files:\n1. Trial start times\n2. Spike counts by unit and cell type\n3. Raster plots of spike times aligned to trial onsets\n4. Peri-Stimulus Time Histograms (PSTHs)\n5. Comparison of PSTHs between different PRF conditions\n6. Response ratio comparison between conditions\nThis demonstrates visualization of multiple independent pieces of data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "advanced-visualization",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook includes several advanced visualizations that combine multiple types of data:\n1. The raster plots that align spike times with trial onsets and mark stimulus timing\n2. The PSTHs that combine spike timing data with trial timing data and include error bars\n3. The comparison of neural responses between different PRF conditions for different cell types\n4. The response modulation plot that includes statistical significance markers\n\nHowever, there are issues with the interpretation of these visualizations, particularly with the stimulus offset timing, and the significance of the results is overstated."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The plots in the notebook are generally of reasonable quality in terms of technical execution. They have appropriate labels, titles, and color coding. However, there are some issues with the density of labels in some plots (like the spike count plot with difficult-to-read unit IDs) and with the interpretability and layout of others. The plots are functional but could be improved."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "There are several major issues with the plots:\n1. The stimulus offset line is consistently placed at 2 seconds, which is incorrect. According to the documentation, the actual stimulus duration was 67 ms, not 2 seconds.\n2. The raster plots and PSTHs use inappropriate time windows that likely fail to capture the relevant neural activity changes.\n3. The spike count plot has x-axis labels that are difficult to read due to angle and density.\n4. The response modulation plot could benefit from better organization and scaling to highlight any meaningful differences.\n\nThese issues significantly impact the interpretability and accuracy of the analyses."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-redundancy",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "There is some minor redundancy in the plots. For example, multiple raster plots and PSTHs are shown for different units, and they all appear to show similar patterns. While it's reasonable to show examples from different units or conditions, the notebook could have reduced redundancy by being more selective or by showing composite results. However, this redundancy is not excessive and each plot does contribute some unique information."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "There are multiple major unsupported conclusions in the notebook:\n1. The claim that \"some units show changes in firing rate in response to the stimulus onset or offset\" when the PSTHs do not visually demonstrate such changes.\n2. The statement about cell types responding differently to different PRFs, despite no statistically significant differences being found.\n3. The misinterpretation of the stimulus duration as 2.2 seconds rather than the actual 67 ms.\n4. The summary conclusions that overstate the findings and make claims not supported by the data.\n\nThese unsupported conclusions significantly impact the validity of the analysis."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "There are some additional issues with the notebook:\n1. Ambiguity in the meaning of cell type labels (1.0 and 2.0) without explanation.\n2. The bin size chosen for the PSTHs (0.05s) may be too large to capture transient responses to the brief (67ms) stimulus.\n3. The analysis windows chosen for comparing pre- and post-stimulus activity may not be appropriate given the brief stimulus duration.\n4. Limiting analysis to a subset of units without clear justification or assessment of how representative they are.\n\nThese issues affect the analysis but are not as severe as the misrepresentation of the stimulus duration or the unsupported conclusions."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "overall-effectiveness",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "The notebook demonstrates competence in loading and visualizing data from the Dandiset, which is positive. It shows how to access NWB files, extract different types of data, and create various visualizations. However, the effectiveness is significantly undermined by:\n1. Misunderstanding or misrepresenting key experimental parameters (stimulus duration)\n2. Drawing conclusions not supported by the data\n3. Using analysis approaches that may not be appropriate for the specific experiment\n4. Overstating the significance of the results\n\nWhile the notebook provides a starting point for exploring this dataset, the issues mentioned would likely mislead a reader about the actual findings and appropriate analysis approaches. On balance, I would rate it as somewhat ineffective given these serious limitations."
