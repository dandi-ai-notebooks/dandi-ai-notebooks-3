    {
      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook provides a detailed overview of Dandiset 000945 in Cell 3, including the experimental design (electrophysiology with tFUS in rats), data acquisition methods, and file naming conventions. It also includes the original dataset description by the authors and a neurosift link (although there is a typo in the link). The introduction in Cell 1 also briefly describes the Dandiset content. Overall, the description is quite thorough."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "Cell 5 effectively demonstrates how to connect to the DANDI archive using the dandi package, retrieve Dandiset 000945, and list the first five assets contained within the Dandiset. The code establishes a connection to the DANDI API, retrieves the specified Dandiset, iterates through the assets, and prints the file paths. This clearly shows users how to load Dandiset information."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "Cells 6 and 7 demonstrate loading an NWB file from the Dandiset using remfile, h5py, and pynwb. The notebook extracts and prints key metadata attributes including session description, identifier, session start time, institution, and subject ID. While there is a potential issue with the subject ID mismatch that wasn't addressed, the overall demonstration of loading NWB file information is clear."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook loads multiple pieces of data from the NWB file:\n1. Trial start and stop times (Cell 9)\n2. Spike times for multiple units (Cell 11)\n3. Cell type labels (Cell 11)\nEach of these represents an independent piece of data from the NWB file."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook visualizes two different types of data:\n1. Trial durations (Cell 9) - though the visualization has issues with the y-axis scaling\n2. Spike times for the first 10 units (Cell 11) - displayed as vertical lines on a plot\n\nWhile there are quality issues with these visualizations, they do represent two independent pieces of data being visualized."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "advanced-visualization",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook does not create any advanced visualizations that combine multiple types of data. The visualizations present are basic, showing only one type of data at a time (trial durations or spike times), and don't integrate multiple data types into a single informative display."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "Both plots in the notebook have significant issues:\n1. The trial duration plot (Cell 9) has a problematic y-axis scale (1e-12+2.2), making it uninformative\n2. The spike times plot (Cell 11) shows only a very small portion of the recording (< 1 second) when there are 500 trials each lasting 2.5 seconds\n3. The cell type labels are shown as numerical values (1.0 and 2.0) without explanation\n\nWhile the plots do display data, their quality and informativeness are poor."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": -3,
      "thinking": "There are major issues with both plots:\n1. The trial duration plot has an extremely problematic y-axis scale (1e-12+2.2) that makes the plot uninformative and suggests an error in data processing or interpretation\n2. The spike times plot shows only a tiny fraction of the available data (< 1 second of a multi-trial recording), which is misleading\n\nThese represent major issues that significantly impact the usefulness and interpretability of the visualizations."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "analysis-issues",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "The analysis has several issues:\n1. Subject ID mismatch - the code uses the asset ID for one subject but the output shows data from another subject (BH498 rather than BH497)\n2. The extremely small trial durations (1e-12+2.2 seconds) suggest an error in data processing\n3. The spike time visualization shows only a tiny fraction of the available data\n4. The cell type labels (1.0 and 2.0) are not explained or utilized properly in the analysis\n\nThese represent at least two major issues that impact the reliability and usefulness of the analysis."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook is fairly conservative in drawing conclusions, focusing mainly on describing the data rather than making specific claims. Cell 12 suggests potential avenues for future analysis but does not make unsupported claims about the current data. I don't see any significant unsupported conclusions in the notebook."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "There are a few other issues with the notebook:\n1. The neurosift link in Cell 3 contains an incorrect Dandiset ID (001176 instead of 000945)\n2. The notebook doesn't properly handle or acknowledge the UserWarning messages about conflicting versions of libraries\n3. The code for finding unit indices in Cell 11 assumes that unit_id is present in unit_ids without validation\n\nThese represent minor issues that don't severely impact the overall functionality but should be addressed."
