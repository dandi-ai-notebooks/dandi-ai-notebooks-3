    {
      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook provides a detailed overview of Dandiset 000945 in Cell 3, including the experimental design, data acquisition methods, and file naming conventions. It includes the original dataset description and outlines the key steps the notebook will cover. However, there is a typo in the neurosift link where the Dandiset ID is incorrect. Despite this minor issue, the description is thorough."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "Cell 5 demonstrates how to use the 'dandi' package to connect to the DANDI archive, retrieve Dandiset 000945, and list the first five assets. This effectively shows how to load information about the Dandiset."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "Cell 7 shows how to load an NWB file using 'remfile', 'h5py', and 'pynwb', and then extracts and prints key metadata attributes from the NWB file. Despite the issue with a possible mismatch in the subject ID, the notebook does demonstrate how to load and access basic information from an NWB file."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook shows how to load two different types of data: trial start/stop times in Cell 9 and spike times and cell type labels in Cell 11. These represent two independent pieces of data from the NWB file."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook visualizes two different pieces of data: trial durations in Cell 9 and spike times in Cell 11. These represent two independent visualizations of data from the NWB file."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The plots in the notebook have significant issues. The trial duration plot in Cell 9 has a problematic y-axis scale that renders it uninformative, and the spike times plot in Cell 11 only shows a very small portion of the data (less than 1 second) without proper context for the cell type labels. These issues significantly reduce the quality of the plots."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "There are major issues with both plots. The trial duration plot has a misleading y-axis scale (showing values like \"1e-12+2.2\") that obscures any meaningful variation. The spike times plot only shows less than 1 second of data from what should be a much longer recording, and doesn't explain what the numerical cell type labels (1.0 and 2.0) represent. These are major issues that significantly impair the usefulness of the visualizations."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "analysis-issues",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "There are major issues with the analysis. The trial durations appear to be on the order of 1e-12+2.2 seconds, which is physically impossible and suggests an error in data processing. Additionally, the spike analysis only looks at a tiny fraction of the available data (less than 1 second), which is not representative of the full dataset that includes 500 trials. The code also assumes unit_id is present in unit_ids without verification."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook doesn't make many strong conclusions, but it does suggest potential avenues for future analysis in Cell 12. These suggestions are reasonable based on the type of data available, even if the analysis in the notebook itself is limited. There don't appear to be unsupported conclusions drawn from the data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "There are a few other issues: 1) The neurosift link contains an incorrect Dandiset ID (001176 instead of 000945), 2) There's a mismatch between the asset ID used and the subject ID reported in the metadata (suggests BH498 vs. BH497), and 3) The notebook doesn't address or suppress the UserWarning messages about conflicting versions. These are relatively minor issues compared to the problems with the plots and analysis."
