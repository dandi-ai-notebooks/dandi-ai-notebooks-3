    {
      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook introduces Dandiset 000945 as containing neural spiking data from awake rat somatosensory cortex responding to transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation. The description is brief but provides the essential context. However, it doesn't go into much detail about the experimental design, the significance of the study, or the available data types beyond mentioning spikes and trials. The Neurosift link is also incorrect."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook uses the dandi library to connect to the DANDI archive, retrieve the specified Dandiset (000945), and list the first 5 assets (NWB files). This demonstrates a standard approach to accessing and exploring a Dandiset programmatically."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook loads an NWB file from a URL in cell 8 and extracts trial information (start/stop times) and spiking data (spike times, cell types, unit IDs) in cells 8 and 11. The basic loading of NWB data is demonstrated well."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook loads multiple pieces of data from NWB files: 1) trial start and stop times, 2) spike times, and 3) cell type labels and unit IDs. This demonstrates loading at least three independent pieces of data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook visualizes two pieces of data: 1) trial durations in a histogram (cell 8) and 2) spike counts per unit in a bar plot (cell 11). These are two independent visualizations of different aspects of the data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The plots have appropriate titles, axis labels, and are readable. However, there are issues with the histogram bins (too coarse) and the bar plot may be based on incorrectly accessed data. The plots are functional but not optimal."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "There are two notable issues with the plots: 1) The histogram uses only two bins, which is likely too coarse to accurately represent the distribution, and 2) The bar plot of spike counts may be based on incorrectly accessed data due to indexing issues with nwb.units['spike_times']. These are significant issues that affect the accuracy and usefulness of the visualizations."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "analysis-issues",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "The main analysis issue is the incorrect indexing of spike times data in cell 11, which likely led to inaccurate spike counts. Additionally, the cell type labels are not properly extracted and displayed. These issues affect the accuracy of the analysis."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "The notebook makes minimal interpretations and does not draw many conclusions. The observations about trial durations and spike counts are directly based on the visualizations, though the spike count observations may be inaccurate due to data access issues. There are no major unsupported conclusions."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "There are a few minor issues: 1) The Neurosift link is incorrect (points to dandiset 001176/000945), 2) There's inconsistency in subject IDs between cells (sub-BH497 vs sub-BH498), which may cause confusion. These are relatively minor issues that don't significantly impair understanding or usage."
