    {
      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook does provide a good introductory description of the Dandiset, including its ID (000945), a summary of the experimental data (tFUS stimulation in rats), and sharing the Neurosift link. However, it doesn't go into extensive detail about the experimental design or methodology, which would be helpful for a full understanding."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook shows how to connect to the DANDI archive, retrieve the Dandiset by ID, and list assets within it. It also organizes the assets by subject and shows the structure of the dataset. This demonstrates a reasonable approach to loading information about the Dandiset."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook shows how to load a specific NWB file using its asset ID, constructing the file path and URL, and using remfile, h5py, and pynwb to load and read the contents. It also demonstrates how to access basic metadata from the NWB file. However, there's inconsistency between the stated subject (BH497) and the file identifier (BH498_3000_200_anes), which is concerning."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook loads several independent pieces of data from the NWB file: electrode information (converted to a DataFrame), trial information (converted to a DataFrame), and neural unit data (including spike times and cell type labels). This demonstrates good coverage of different data types within the NWB file."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook visualizes multiple types of data: trial durations and inter-trial intervals (histograms), spike activity (raster plots and PSTHs), response type distributions (stacked bar chart), modulation index distributions (boxplot and swarmplot), and neural responses across trials (heatmap). This shows a good variety of visualization techniques for different aspects of the data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "advanced-visualization",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook includes several advanced visualizations that combine multiple types of data, such as the raster plots with PSTHs that align spike times with trial events, and the trial heatmap that visualizes firing rates across trials and time. These are well-constructed visualizations that effectively combine different data elements."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "While the plots do show the data, there are several issues with them. The trial duration distribution has an incorrect x-axis scale, making it impossible to interpret. The raster plots lack clear y-axis tick marks. The plots generally fail to account for different stimulation parameters, limiting their interpretability. The visualizations are functional but have notable flaws."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": -3,
      "thinking": "There are several major issues with the plots: 1) The trial duration distribution has an incorrect x-axis scale (showing \"1e-12+2.2\" with values near -2), making it uninterpretable. 2) The raster plots lack clear y-axis tick marks. 3) The stimulus offset is plotted outside the active scanning window in some graphs. 4) The plots do not differentiate between trials with different ultrasound parameters, severely limiting their usefulness."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-redundancy",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "There is some redundancy in the plots, particularly with the multiple raster plots and PSTHs for different units that show very similar patterns of \"no response.\" However, this is not excessive, as comparing responses across different units is a valid analytical approach."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": -3,
      "thinking": "The notebook makes claims about analyzing neuron responses to ultrasound stimulation and comparing responses between different cell types, but these conclusions are not supported by the analysis. The fundamental flaw is that the analyses average responses across all trials regardless of stimulation parameters, making it impossible to draw valid conclusions about specific responses to ultrasound settings. This is a major issue that undermines the central claims of the notebook."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": -3,
      "thinking": "There are several other major issues: 1) Inconsistency between the stated subject (BH497) and the file identifier (BH498_3000_200_anes). 2) The notebook fails to link neural responses to different pulse frequencies, which was a stated goal. 3) The trial metadata lacks important information about stimulus parameters. 4) The statistical analysis (paired t-test) inappropriately assumes independence between trials. 5) The notebook does not adequately link neural units to electrode locations."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "overall-effectiveness",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "The notebook demonstrates how to load data from a Dandiset and create various visualizations, which is helpful for getting started. However, the significant issues with data handling, analysis methodology, and interpretation severely limit its effectiveness. The failure to properly account for varying stimulation parameters, inconsistencies in data identification, and unsupported conclusions make this notebook somewhat ineffective as a guide for analyzing this dataset."
