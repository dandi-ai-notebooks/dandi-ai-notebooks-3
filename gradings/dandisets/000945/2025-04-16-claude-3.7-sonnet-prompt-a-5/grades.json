    {
      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook provides a reasonably good description of the Dandiset. It includes the Dandiset ID (000945), mentions it contains data on tFUS stimulation in rats, and provides a Neurosift link. However, it doesn't go into great detail about the experimental design or the significance of the dataset."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook shows how to load the Dandiset very well. It connects to the DANDI archive, retrieves Dandiset \"000945\", and lists the assets within it. It also organizes the assets by subject and displays the structure clearly."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook demonstrates loading basic information from an NWB file reasonably well. It selects a specific NWB file, loads it using remfile and h5py, and examines metadata including file identifier, session description, and subject information. It also explores electrode and device information."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook loads multiple independent pieces of data from the NWB file: electrode information, trial data, and neural unit data (spike times and cell type labels). It converts these to Pandas DataFrames for easier manipulation."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook visualizes multiple pieces of data: trial duration and inter-trial interval distributions, raster plots and PSTHs for neural activity, a stacked bar chart showing response type distributions, a boxplot comparing modulation indices between cell types, and a heatmap of trial-to-trial variability in neural responses."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "advanced-visualization",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook attempts to create advanced visualizations involving multiple types of data, particularly in the raster plots and PSTHs that align neural spike data with stimulus timing, and in the trial heatmap visualization. However, due to analytical flaws (not accounting for stimulus parameters, data quality issues), these visualizations don't effectively reveal meaningful patterns in the data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The plot quality is reasonably good in terms of basic visualization elements, but there are several issues with axis scaling, missing tick marks, and other problems that reduce their interpretability."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": -3,
      "thinking": "There are multiple major issues with the plots: the x-axis scale of the trial duration distribution plot is incorrect, the raster plots lack y-axis tick marks, many plots fail to account for different stimulation parameters, and the analysis window may exclude relevant portions of the data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "analysis-issues",
      "grade": -3,
      "thinking": "There are multiple major issues with the analysis: the notebook fails to account for different ultrasound stimulation parameters (PRF) in the analysis, it improperly calculates firing rates, inappropriately averages across all trials regardless of stimulation parameters, and uses statistical tests that may violate assumptions about independence."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "The summary at the end draws unsupported conclusions about neuronal responses to ultrasound stimulation and comparing responses between different cell types, when the analysis didn't properly account for varying stimulation parameters. Additionally, there are discrepancies in subject IDs (BH497 vs BH498) that are not addressed."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "There are several other issues: inconsistency between the file identifier and the subject ID, lack of specificity in electrode location information, absence of proper linking between neural units and electrode locations or stimulus conditions, and poor trial duration distributions."
