    {
      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook provides a brief description of the Dandiset 000945 in Cell 4, explaining that it contains neural spiking data from the somatosensory cortex of awake rats with transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (tFUS), and mentions pulse repetition frequencies (PRFs) as key experimental variables. While this gives a basic understanding of the dataset, it doesn't go into great detail about the experimental design, the significance of the research, or the specific structure of the data. The description is sufficient but not comprehensive."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "Cell 12 demonstrates how to load the Dandiset using DandiAPIClient, connect to the DANDI archive, retrieve the Dandiset with ID \"000945\", and list its assets. It also shows the output confirming that 75 assets were found and lists the paths of the first 5 assets. This provides a clear and effective demonstration of how to access and explore the Dandiset."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "Cell 15 shows how to load an NWB file using remfile, h5py, and pynwb. Cell 17 demonstrates accessing and displaying metadata from the loaded NWB file, including session description, identifier, session start time, and information about the electrode group. Cell 19 retrieves and displays the column names of the electrodes table. However, there is a significant inconsistency between the file that was supposed to be loaded (from subject BH497) and the actual data loaded (from subject BH498), which reduces the reliability of the demonstration."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook loads two main pieces of data from the NWB file: (1) spike times for a subset of units (Cell 22), and (2) cell type labels for these units (Cell 22). It also accesses metadata about electrodes (Cell 19) and session information (Cell 17). While the notebook effectively demonstrates loading these data types, it doesn't show loading of three or more independent pieces of data beyond spike times, cell types, and basic metadata."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook provides two visualizations of the NWB data: (1) a scatter plot of spike times versus spike number, colored by cell type (Cell 22), and (2) a histogram showing the distribution of spike times, separated by cell type, with kernel density estimates overlaid (Cell 26). These visualizations effectively demonstrate how to plot different aspects of the spike time data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "advanced-visualization",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "Neither of the visualizations in the notebook qualifies as truly \"advanced.\" The scatter plot in Cell 22 shows spike times colored by cell type, and the histogram in Cell 26 shows the distribution of spike times separated by cell type. While these visualizations do combine multiple pieces of information (spike times and cell types), they are relatively standard plots that don't demonstrate advanced techniques like multi-panel figures, 3D visualizations, interactive plots, or complex compositions of different data types."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The plots in the notebook are functional but have some issues. The scatter plot in Cell 22 has a misleading y-axis label (\"Spike Number\") that doesn't accurately describe what's being plotted. Both visualizations arbitrarily truncate the data to the first 10 seconds without clear justification. The plots include proper axis labels, legends, and use appropriate visual encoding (color for cell types), but the descriptions of the plots (Cells 23 and 27) are minimal and don't offer meaningful insights."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "There are several issues with the plots: (1) The y-axis label \"Spike Number\" in Cell 22 is misleading as it's merely an index and doesn't represent a meaningful quantity. (2) Both visualizations arbitrarily limit spike times to 10 seconds without explanation, potentially introducing bias and limiting the scope of conclusions. (3) The scatter plot combines all units into one visualization, making it difficult to distinguish patterns for individual units. (4) The descriptions of the plots in Cells 23 and 27 are too general and don't offer specific insights. These are significant issues that affect the interpretability of the visualizations."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "analysis-issues",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "The analysis has a major issue in that there's an inconsistency between the file that was supposed to be loaded (from subject BH497) and the actual data loaded (from subject BH498). This discrepancy creates confusion and reduces the reliability of the notebook's claims. Additionally, the notebook mentions that units were randomly selected for visualization, but doesn't explain how this random selection was performed or whether the results are representative of the whole dataset. The arbitrary truncation of spike times to 10 seconds also limits the generalizability of the analysis. These are significant issues that affect the validity of the analysis."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook is quite cautious and does not draw many explicit conclusions from the data. The descriptions of the plots in Cells 23 and 27 are very general and mainly describe what is shown rather than interpreting patterns or making claims. Cell 30 suggests future research directions but doesn't make unsupported claims about the current data. While the analysis has issues that would limit the conclusions that could be drawn, the notebook itself doesn't make unsupported claims."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "A major issue is the inconsistency in the subject ID. Cell 14 claims to be using data from subject BH497, but Cell 17 reveals that the loaded data is actually from subject BH498. This discrepancy creates confusion and reduces the reliability of the notebook. Additionally, the notebook uses a hardcoded URL for loading the NWB file, which makes it less flexible and more difficult to reuse with different files. The final summary in Cell 29 is generic and doesn't reflect on the caveats found in the data and code. These are significant issues that affect the overall quality and reliability of the notebook."
