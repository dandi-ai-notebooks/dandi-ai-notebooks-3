      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook provides a thorough description of the Dandiset 000945 in cells 3-4, including the experimental setup, parameters, and the types of data available (neural spiking data from rat somatosensory cortex during transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation). It outlines the experimental parameters, including the number of trials, pulse repetition frequencies, pulse duration, and ultrasound duration. It also mentions the recording equipment and data types available (spike times, cell type labels, and ultrasound stimulation timestamps)."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook effectively loads information about the Dandiset in cells 7-10. It connects to the DANDI Archive using DandiAPIClient, retrieves the dandiset with ID \"000945\", lists the first five assets (NWB files), and displays key metadata including the identifier, version, name, description, and license information."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook loads basic information from an NWB file in cells 11-18. It accesses a specific NWB file using its URL, displays basic session and subject information (session description, identifier, start time, institution, subject ID, species, sex, age). It also extracts and displays electrode information, trial information, and unit (neuron) information. However, there's a discrepancy between the subject ID in the URL (BH498) and the subject information from the NWB file (BH497)."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook loads multiple pieces of data from the NWB file: 1) electrode information (cell 14), 2) trial information including start/stop times (cell 16), 3) unit (neuron) information including spike times and cell types (cell 18, 21), 4) firing rate data across different time windows (cell 27). This demonstrates loading at least three independent pieces of data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook visualizes multiple aspects of the data: 1) trial durations histogram (cell 16), 2) distribution of cell types (cell 18), 3) raster plots and PSTHs for selected units (cell 25), 4) boxplots comparing firing rate changes by cell type (cell 29), 5) heatmap of firing rates across trials and mean firing rate plot (cell 31), and 6) bar plots comparing responses by cell type (cell 33). This demonstrates visualizing at least three independent pieces of data."

    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The plots generally display the intended information with appropriate labels and formatting. However, there are several issues noted: the histogram in cell 16 has scaling issues with the x-axis, the raster plots in cell 25 appear very dense making patterns difficult to discern, and the bar plots in cell 33 have layout issues. While the plots convey relevant information, these issues prevent them from being considered very high quality."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": -3,
      "thinking": "Several issues with the plots were identified: 1) The histogram in cell 16 has serious scaling issues with the x-axis showing very large values (order of 1e12+2.2) making it misleading, 2) The raster plots in cell 25 are too dense making patterns hard to discern, 3) The boxplots in cell 29 don't clearly show distinctions between cell types despite this being a stated goal, 4) The bar plots in cell 33 have inconsistent x-axis scales and layout issues (elements likely overlapping). These represent at least two major issues."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "analysis-issues",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "The notebook has several analysis issues: 1) The calculation of firing rate in cell 21 doesn't account for the pulse repetition frequency and could be refined, 2) The statistical analysis in cell 27 shows very small changes (0.09% and 0.24%) but doesn't properly interpret what these mean, 3) The cell type comparison in cells 29 and 33 fails to demonstrate clear differences between cell types despite this being a stated goal, 4) There's a discrepancy between the subject ID in the URL (BH498) and the subject information from the NWB file (BH497) in cell 12. These represent at least two major issues."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "The main unsupported conclusion is in cell 34, where the summary claims that \"Different cell types showed varying responses to the stimulation.\" This is not clearly demonstrated by the analyses and visualizations in cells 29 and 33, which show minimal differences between cell types. The plots do not support this conclusion, and no statistical significance is shown for these differences. This represents one major unsupported conclusion."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "Other issues include: 1) The notebook doesn't explain what cell type labels 1.0 and 2.0 refer to, making interpretation difficult (cell 18), 2) The method used to select a \"responsive\" unit in cell 31 may not be optimal for demonstrating trial-to-trial variability, 3) The histogram in cell 16 suggests all trials have exactly the same duration (std = 0), which seems unlikely and should be examined. These represent minor issues that affect understanding but don't fundamentally compromise the notebook's functionality."
