      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook provides a thorough description of the dandiset in cells 3 and 4, explaining the experimental setup involving neural spiking data from rat somatosensory cortex during transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation. It details experimental parameters, recording equipment, and the types of data available. Cell 10 also explores the dandiset metadata including identifier, version, name, description, and license information."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook demonstrates loading the dandiset effectively in cells 7-10. It connects to the DANDI Archive using DandiAPIClient, retrieves the dandiset with ID \"000945\", lists the first five assets, and retrieves and displays the dandiset's metadata. This provides a comprehensive approach to loading and exploring basic dandiset information."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "Cells 11-12 show how to load an NWB file from the DANDI Archive using its URL with remfile, h5py, and pynwb. The notebook extracts and displays basic information from the NWB file including session description, identifier, start time, institution, subject information, etc. However, there is a discrepancy between the subject ID in the URL (BH498) and the subject information from the NWB file (BH497)."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook demonstrates loading multiple types of data from the NWB file:\n1. Electrode information (cells 13-14)\n2. Trial information related to ultrasound stimulation (cells 15-16)\n3. Unit/neuron information including spike times and cell types (cells 17-18)\nThe notebook loads more than three independent pieces of data, providing a comprehensive exploration of the dataset."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook visualizes multiple types of data:\n1. Trial durations histogram (cell 16)\n2. Distribution of cell types bar graph (cell 18)\n3. Raster plots and PSTHs for multiple units (cell 25)\n4. Boxplots of firing rate changes by cell type (cell 29)\n5. Heatmap of firing rates across trials and mean firing rate plot (cell 31)\n6. Horizontal bar plots comparing cell type responses (cell 33)\nThis represents more than three independent visualizations of the data."

    {
      "question_id": "advanced-visualization",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "Cell 25 creates advanced visualizations involving multiple types of data - raster plots and peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs) for three selected units. Cell 31 also creates an advanced visualization combining a heatmap showing trial-to-trial variability in neural responses with a mean firing rate plot that includes standard error. These visualizations effectively combine different aspects of the neural data to provide insight into the responses to ultrasound stimulation."

    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "While the notebook includes multiple visualizations, there are several issues with plot quality:\n- The histogram in cell 16 has inappropriate x-axis scaling\n- The raster plots in cell 25 appear very dense and could benefit from refinement\n- The boxplots in cell 29 use inconsistent axes\n- Cell 33 notes \"tight layout not applied\" indicating potential layout issues\nThese issues reduce the overall quality of the visualizations."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": -3,
      "thinking": "There are multiple major issues with the plots:\n1. The trial duration histogram (cell 16) has a severely misleading x-axis with values around 1e12+2.2 instead of appropriate scaling\n2. The boxplots in cell 29 use inconsistent x-axis ranges, making comparison difficult\n3. The raster plots in cell 25 are too dense to clearly show patterns\n4. The visualizations generally lack clear statistical indicators of significance"
    },
    {
      "question_id": "analysis-issues",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "The analysis has several notable issues:\n1. Discrepancy between subject ID in URL (BH498) and NWB file (BH497) in cell 12\n2. The firing rate calculation method may not be optimal for this experimental design (cell 21)\n3. The analysis doesn't effectively distinguish between cell types despite being a stated goal\n4. Statistical significance measures are limited, particularly when comparing cell types\n5. The notebook fails to provide clear conclusions about the differential effects of ultrasound on different cell types"
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "The summary in cell 34 claims that \"Different cell types showed varying responses to the stimulation\" but this is not clearly demonstrated in the analysis. The visualizations in cells 29 and 33 show minimal differences between cell types with values clustered around zero. This represents a significant unsupported conclusion about a central aspect of the analysis. The other key findings appear to be supported by the analysis."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "There are some minor additional issues:\n1. The notebook doesn't explain what celltype_label 1.0 and 2.0 represent in cell 18\n2. The mean changes in firing rate are very small (0.09% and 0.24%) but presented as meaningful results\n3. The notebook would benefit from more domain-specific context and interpretation\n4. Some cells use display() which may not work correctly in all environments"
