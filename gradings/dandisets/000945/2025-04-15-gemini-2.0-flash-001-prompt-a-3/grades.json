    {
      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook does a good job of introducing the Dandiset in Cell 1, providing context about the experiment, data acquisition methods, subject details, and file naming conventions. It also outlines the notebook's objectives clearly. The notebook introduces the Dandiset (000945) and consistently references it throughout."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "Cell 2 demonstrates how to use the `dandi` library to connect to the DANDI archive, retrieve the Dandiset, and list available assets. It shows how to access the Dandiset by ID and display basic information about the contained files. This provides a clear introduction to loading Dandiset information."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The notebook shows how to load an NWB file in Cell 4, using remfile and h5py to handle the remote file, then using pynwb to read the file into an nwb object. There is an inconsistency between the file the notebook claims to load (in Cell 3) and what it actually loads, which is problematic. However, it does effectively demonstrate the mechanics of loading an NWB file and accessing its basic structure."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook loads multiple pieces of data from the NWB file: electrode information (Cell 33-39), trial data (Cell 24-31), spike times data (Cell 47-55), and subject information (Cell 40-46). It shows how to access these different data types and convert them to Pandas DataFrames for easier manipulation."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook visualizes two independent pieces of data: spike times for the first 10 units (Cell 57) and trial start and stop times for the first 10 trials (Cell 59). Both visualizations show data from the NWB file, though they are relatively simple and not integrated with each other."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The plots in the notebook are functional but relatively basic. The spike times plot (Cell 57) shows spike times for multiple units with color coding for cell types, and the trial times plot (Cell 59) shows start and stop times with different colors. The plots include titles and axis labels, but there are issues with overlapping labels in the legend of the spike times plot, and the trial times plot could be more informative with numbered tick marks."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "There are some issues with the plots. The spike times plot has overlapping labels in the legend, making it difficult to read. The trial times plot removes y-axis tick marks, reducing its informativeness. Neither plot attempts to correlate neural activity with stimulation times, which would have been more insightful. These are minor issues that affect readability and interpretability but don't completely undermine the plots' utility."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "analysis-issues",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "The analysis in the notebook is primarily descriptive, focusing on loading and displaying data rather than conducting sophisticated analyses. There is one major issue: the notebook claims to load one NWB file in Cell 3 but actually loads a different one in Cell 4, creating confusion about which data is being analyzed. This inconsistency represents a significant problem for reproducibility and understanding."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook generally avoids drawing unsupported conclusions. It primarily focuses on data loading and visualization without making strong claims about the data's meaning. The summary in Cell 60 suggests directions for future analysis but doesn't make unfounded claims about the current results."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "The most significant other issue is that the notebook suggests comparing neural activity across different PRFs in its conclusion, but only analyzes one NWB file and does not demonstrate how to access different NWB files for comparison. This is a significant omission given the stated objectives. There are also some dependency warnings in the output of Cell 4, but these are minor issues."
