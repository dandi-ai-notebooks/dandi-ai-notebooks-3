  "prompt_version": "3",
  "grades": [
    {
      "question_id": "describe-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook's first cell provides a good description of the Dandiset, including the experiment type (ultrasound stimulation), data acquisition methods, subject details, and file naming conventions. It also outlines the notebook's objectives. This gives a reasonably complete context for understanding the data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-dandiset",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook uses the dandi library to connect to the DANDI archive, retrieve the Dandiset with ID \"000945\", and list available assets. It also shows how to count assets and display file paths. This demonstrates basic Dandiset loading well."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook shows how to load an NWB file and access its basic attributes, including session description, identifier, session start time, and timestamps reference time. It also explores electrode groups, devices, trials, electrodes, subject information, and units. This demonstrates NWB loading very thoroughly."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "load-nwb-data",
      "grade": 3,
      "thinking": "The notebook loads several types of data from the NWB file, including: 1) spike times from the units table, 2) trial start and stop times, 3) electrode information. These represent three independent pieces of data from the NWB file."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "visualize-nwb-data",
      "grade": 2,
      "thinking": "The notebook creates two visualizations: 1) a scatter plot of spike times for the first 10 units, and 2) a plot of trial start and stop times for the first 10 trials. This shows visualization of two independent pieces of data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "advanced-visualization",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook does not create any advanced visualizations that combine multiple types of data (such as overlaying spike times on trial periods, or correlating spike activity with stimulation parameters). The visualizations are simple and separate."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-quality",
      "grade": 1,
      "thinking": "The plots are functional but have issues. The spike times scatter plot has overlapping labels in the legend making it difficult to read. The trial start/stop plot has an intentionally unlabeled y-axis which limits its informativeness. The plots convey basic information but are not of very good quality."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "plot-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "There are some noteworthy issues with the plots: 1) The spike times plot has overlapping labels in the legend, 2) The trial start/stop plot removes y-axis ticks making it less informative, 3) Neither plot effectively communicates the relationship between stimulation and neural activity. These are relatively minor issues that affect interpretability but don't completely invalidate the plots."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "analysis-issues",
      "grade": -2,
      "thinking": "One major issue is the discrepancy between the notebook's stated intention to load one NWB file (~sub-BH497/sub-BH497_ses-20240310T143729_ecephys.nwb) and the actual file loaded (based on the identifier BH498_3000_200_anes). This creates confusion about which data is actually being analyzed."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "unsupported-conclusions",
      "grade": 0,
      "thinking": "The notebook doesn't draw many conclusions about the data, focusing instead on demonstration of loading and basic visualization. The final cell suggests potential future analyses but doesn't make unsupported claims about the current data."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "other-issues",
      "grade": -1,
      "thinking": "The notebook generates UserWarnings related to conflicting versions of hdmf-common, core, and hdmf-experimental. While not critical errors, these indicate potential dependency management issues. Additionally, the notebook suggests comparing neural activity across different PRFs but only analyzes one NWB file without demonstrating how to access others. These are minor issues that don't prevent the notebook from functioning."
