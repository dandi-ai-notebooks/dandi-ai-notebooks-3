Rank 1: 2025-04-16-claude-3.7-sonnet-prompt-a-4
This notebook (2025-04-16-claude-3.7-sonnet-prompt-a-4) provides a comprehensive exploration of the Dandiset with multiple well-executed visualizations across different data types (metadata, electrode locations, behavioral data, LFP recordings, spike data, and stimuli). The notebook has a clear structure, guides users through a logical workflow, and provides useful context about the dataset. There are only minor issues with empty plots for one condition and image ID display. Overall, it seems to be the most complete and well-executed notebook.

2025-04-16-claude-3.7-sonnet-prompt-b-4 is also quite comprehensive, covering behavioral data, LFP data, and visual stimuli. However, it has some methodological problems with the trial phase analysis and theta-gamma coupling sections, which contain serious flaws that render their conclusions invalid.

2025-04-16-claude-3.7-sonnet-prompt-b-5 is similarly comprehensive, covering behavioral and neural data at multiple scales, but has some technical issues including incorrect LFP voltage scaling and overinterpretation of neural function.

2025-04-15-claude-3.7-sonnet-prompt-a-3 attempts to cover a wide range of analyses but has critical failures in electrode-unit mapping that cascade into multiple empty or failed visualizations.

2025-04-16-claude-3.7-sonnet-prompt-a-5 provides good behavioral analysis but fails in its neural data analyses due to unit selection failures.

2025-04-15-claude-3.7-sonnet-prompt-b-3 has comprehensive scope but major issues with timing errors and electrode/unit location errors that undermine many of the visualizations.

2025-04-15-gemini-2.0-flash-001-prompt-a-3, 2025-04-15-gpt-4o-prompt-b-3, 2025-04-16-gemini-2.0-flash-001-prompt-a-4, 2025-04-16-gpt-4o-prompt-a-4, 2025-04-15-gemini-2.0-flash-001-prompt-b-3, 2025-04-15-gpt-4o-prompt-a-3, and 2025-04-16-gemini-2.0-flash-001-prompt-b-4 are more limited in scope, primarily focusing on basic data loading and visualization without deeper analyses.

2025-04-16-gpt-4o-prompt-b-4 has the most severe issues, including analyzing the wrong dataset entirely.

Based on this assessment, I'll rank the notebooks starting with the most effective ones.

2025-04-16-claude-3.7-sonnet-prompt-b-5 offers a comprehensive introduction to the dataset with both behavioral and neural data analysis across multiple scales. It has some issues with LFP voltage scaling and statistical rigor, but overall provides solid visualization and analysis techniques that relate neural activity to cognitive processes.

Rank 4: 2025-04-15-gemini-2.0-flash-001-prompt-a-3
2025-04-15-gemini-2.0-flash-001-prompt-a-3 provides a clear introduction to the dataset with well-structured sections on data access, metadata exploration, and basic visualizations of LFP data, stimulus events, and template images. While it has some issues with potential data orientation and unclear units, it successfully introduces the key components of the dataset.

Rank 5: 2025-04-16-claude-3.7-sonnet-prompt-a-5
2025-04-16-claude-3.7-sonnet-prompt-a-5 has a good introduction and structure, with effective behavioral data analysis showing task accuracy and response time distributions. It displays stimulus images and attempts to show spike data, but fails in the neural data analysis sections due to coding errors in unit selection. It's still valuable for understanding the dataset structure and behavioral components.

Rank 6: 2025-04-15-claude-3.7-sonnet-prompt-b-3
2025-04-15-claude-3.7-sonnet-prompt-b-3 attempts to provide comprehensive analysis including LFP, time-frequency, single unit activity, and behavioral performance. However, it has major issues with timing errors, location attribution failures, and technical issues that prevent it from achieving its full potential. The misalignment between neural activity and trial events makes it difficult to draw valid conclusions.

Rank 7: 2025-04-15-claude-3.7-sonnet-prompt-a-3
2025-04-15-claude-3.7-sonnet-prompt-a-3 demonstrates a wide range of neurophysiological data analysis techniques, but has critical electrode-unit mapping failure that causes multiple key analyses to fail (empty plots). It provides a good framework but the implementation errors prevent it from being fully functional.

Rank 8: 2025-04-15-gpt-4o-prompt-b-3
2025-04-15-gpt-4o-prompt-b-3 effectively introduces the dataset, demonstrates data loading, and creates a clear visualization of LFP data with time-series plots. It's more limited in scope than higher-ranked notebooks but successfully introduces the fundamental aspects of the dataset.

2025-04-16-gemini-2.0-flash-001-prompt-b-4 provides a good introduction to the dataset and includes visualizations of both LFP data (histograms) and stimulus templates. It has a significant issue with ignoring a warning about potentially transposed LFP data, but otherwise successfully demonstrates basic data loading and visualization.

Rank 10: 2025-04-15-gemini-2.0-flash-001-prompt-b-3
2025-04-15-gemini-2.0-flash-001-prompt-b-3 demonstrates data access, metadata exploration, and visualization of LFP data and stimulus templates. It has issues with data transposition warnings and image rotation, but provides basic guidance for exploring the dataset.

2025-04-16-gemini-2.0-flash-001-prompt-a-4 provides structured introduction to the dataset with visualizations of LFP data, event data, and stimulus presentation data. It has issues with temporal inconsistencies, ambiguous plot labels, and plot scaling, but demonstrates basic data access and visualization.

Rank 12: 2025-04-15-gpt-4o-prompt-a-3
2025-04-15-gpt-4o-prompt-a-3 introduces the dataset and demonstrates basic data loading and metadata exploration. The visualization components have serious issues with interpretability, particularly the events plot which lacks critical context. It provides basic understanding of data access but limited insights from visualizations.

Rank 13: 2025-04-16-gpt-4o-prompt-a-4
2025-04-16-gpt-4o-prompt-a-4 demonstrates data loading and basic visualization of LFP signals, but has issues with the visualization including potential dimensional mismatch in the LFP data. It's limited in scope compared to higher-ranked notebooks.
