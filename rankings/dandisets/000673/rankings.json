The notebook has a clear structure, guides users through a logical workflow, and provides useful context about the dataset. There are only minor issues with empty plots for one condition and image ID display. Overall, it seems to be the most complete and well-executed notebook.\n\n2025-04-16-claude-3.7-sonnet-prompt-b-4 is also quite comprehensive, covering behavioral data, LFP data, and visual stimuli. However, it has some methodological problems with the trial phase analysis and theta-gamma coupling sections, which contain serious flaws that render their conclusions invalid.\n\n2025-04-16-claude-3.7-sonnet-prompt-b-5 is similarly comprehensive, covering behavioral and neural data at multiple scales, but has some technical issues including incorrect LFP voltage scaling and overinterpretation of neural function.\n\n2025-04-15-claude-3.7-sonnet-prompt-a-3 attempts to cover a wide range of analyses but has critical failures in electrode-unit mapping that cascade into multiple empty or failed visualizations.\n\n2025-04-16-claude-3.7-sonnet-prompt-a-5 provides good behavioral analysis but fails in its neural data analyses due to unit selection failures.\n\n2025-04-15-claude-3.7-sonnet-prompt-b-3 has comprehensive scope but major issues with timing errors and electrode/unit location errors that undermine many of the visualizations.\n\n2025-04-15-gemini-2.0-flash-001-prompt-a-3, 2025-04-15-gpt-4o-prompt-b-3, 2025-04-16-gemini-2.0-flash-001-prompt-a-4, 2025-04-16-gpt-4o-prompt-a-4, 2025-04-15-gemini-2.0-flash-001-prompt-b-3, 2025-04-15-gpt-4o-prompt-a-3, and 2025-04-16-gemini-2.0-flash-001-prompt-b-4 are more limited in scope, primarily focusing on basic data loading and visualization without deeper analyses.\n\n2025-04-16-gpt-4o-prompt-b-4 has the most severe issues, including analyzing the wrong dataset entirely.\n\nBased on this assessment, I'll rank the notebooks starting with the most effective ones."
