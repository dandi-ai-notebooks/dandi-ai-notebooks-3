It includes multiple high-quality visualizations covering both spatial (ROI locations) and temporal (fluorescence traces) aspects of the data, along with correlation analyses. The notebook excels at guiding users through accessing data, visualizing it in multiple ways, and suggesting future analyses.\n\nNotebook 2025-04-16-claude-3.7-sonnet-prompt-a-5 is also strong, with a good introduction, efficient data loading approaches, and multiple visualizations. However, it has more significant issues than 2025-04-15-claude-3.7-sonnet-prompt-a-3, including data quality problems, visualization errors, and analysis limitations.\n\nNotebook 2025-04-16-claude-3.7-sonnet-prompt-b-5 offers good data exploration and visualization but has more serious flaws in its correlation analysis section, including code problems and misleading interpretations.\n\nNotebook 2025-04-15-gemini-2.0-flash-001-prompt-b-3 provides effective introduction and data loading methods with good visualizations of both fluorescence time series and ROI spatial distribution. It has only minor issues and concludes with valuable suggestions for further analysis.\n\nNotebook 2025-04-15-gemini-2.0-flash-001-prompt-a-3 succeeds in its primary goals but has moderate limitations with its visualizations and limited interpretive context.\n\nNotebook 2025-04-15-claude-3.7-sonnet-prompt-b-3 provides a comprehensive introduction but contains a critical error in interpreting ROI data, which significantly impacts its reliability.\n\nNotebook 2025-04-15-gpt-4o-prompt-b-3 is quite minimal, with basic visualizations that lack processing to reveal meaningful structures and event amplitude analysis that lacks important context.\n\nNotebook 2025-04-15-gpt-4o-prompt-a-3 is the weakest, showing only a single timepoint visualization despite introducing a section about \"neuron activity patterns,\" missing the opportunity to show temporal dynamics.\n\nBased on these assessments, I'll rank them from best to worst."
