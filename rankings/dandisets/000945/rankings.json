The notebook shows multiple analysis approaches including PSTHs for different cell types and pulse repetition frequencies. It effectively demonstrates how different experimental conditions affect neural responses. Most importantly, no significant issues were identified in this notebook - the code functions as intended, visualizations represent the data effectively, and the explanations provide appropriate context. The notebook progresses logically from data loading to increasingly complex analyses.\n\nThis is clearly the highest quality notebook with the most comprehensive analysis and no significant errors."

Inconsistent subject identification between the URL and file metadata\n2. Problems with the trial duration visualization (scale issues)\n3. Dense raster plots that are difficult to interpret\n4. Limited explanation of cell type labels\n5. Small effect sizes in the analyses\n6.
