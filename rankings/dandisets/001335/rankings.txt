Rank 1: 2025-04-15-gpt-4o-prompt-a-3
This notebook (2025-04-15-gpt-4o-prompt-a-3) also introduces Dandiset 001335 containing Neuropixels recordings from mouse hippocampus. Similar to 2025-04-15-gpt-4o-prompt-b-3, it accomplishes all the core goals of a Dandiset introduction notebook:

1. It has a clear title, appropriate disclaimers and comprehensive dataset context
2. It demonstrates connection to the DANDI Archive using the API
3. It shows how to load the Dandiset and access assets
4. It loads and displays metadata from an NWB file
5. It effectively visualizes LFP data with properly labeled plots
6. It suggests future analysis directions

Like 2025-04-15-gpt-4o-prompt-b-3, no issues were identified in this notebook. However, 2025-04-15-gpt-4o-prompt-a-3 appears to have some additional strengths compared to 2025-04-15-gpt-4o-prompt-b-3:
- More comprehensive dataset context including contributors, ID, license, and a DANDI Archive link
- More detailed metadata exploration, displaying key information like session description, identifier, experimenter names, and relevant keywords
- Visualization of multiple electrodes (10) rather than just one channel

These additional features suggest 2025-04-15-gpt-4o-prompt-a-3 provides a slightly more comprehensive introduction to the dataset than 2025-04-15-gpt-4o-prompt-b-3, though both are high-quality notebooks.

Rank 2: 2025-04-15-gpt-4o-prompt-b-3
