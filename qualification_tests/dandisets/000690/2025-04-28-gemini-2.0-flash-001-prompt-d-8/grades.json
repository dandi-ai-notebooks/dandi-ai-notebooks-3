  "image_descriptions": "# Description of Images in the Notebook\n\n## Figure 1: Eye Tracking Data\n\n### Overview\nThis figure shows eye tracking data from the Dandiset, specifically plotting the X and Y positions of the pupil over time. The data spans approximately 15 to 30 seconds. The X position (blue line) appears to be around 370-390 pixels for most of the recording, while the Y position (orange line) fluctuates around 210-230 pixels.\n\n### Minor Issues\n- No apparent formatting issues\n- The axes are properly labeled (\"Time (s)\" and \"Position (pixels)\")\n- The title \"Eye Tracking Data\" and legend are clear\n\n### Notable Features\n- There's a distinct sharp spike/deviation in both X and Y coordinates around the 23-second mark, which might represent either a blink, rapid eye movement, or potentially a tracking error\n- The eye position is relatively stable before and after the spike\n- Overall, the data appears clean and well-recorded\n\n## Figure 2: Running Wheel Data\n\n### Overview\nThis figure displays running wheel rotation measurements over time, spanning approximately 112 to 138 seconds. The rotation is measured in radians, showing when and how much the mouse was running on the wheel.\n\n### Minor Issues\n- No apparent formatting issues\n- Clear axes labels (\"Time (s)\" and \"Rotation (radians)\")\n- Appropriate title and legend\n\n### Notable Features\n- The data shows periods of no movement (flat lines at around 0 radians) interspersed with periods of activity\n- There are several distinct bursts of running activity with varying intensity\n- The highest peak reaches approximately 0.047 radians\n- Some negative values are present, possibly indicating backward wheel movement or measurement oscillations\n- The pattern suggests intermittent running behavior rather than continuous activity\n- The mouse appears to alternate between running and resting\n\nBoth figures effectively visualize the respective data types and provide valuable insights into the animal's behavior during the experiment. The data appears to be of good quality with no major issues in the visualizations.",
