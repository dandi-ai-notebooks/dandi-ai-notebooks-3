  "image_descriptions": "# Image Analysis of Each Figure in the Notebook\n\n## Figure 1: Distribution of Unit Firing Rates\n**Overview:** \nThis histogram shows the distribution of firing rates across all units (neurons) in the dataset. The x-axis represents firing rates in Hz, and the y-axis shows the number of units with each rate. The distribution is right-skewed, with most units having firing rates between 2-8 Hz, and fewer units with higher firing rates extending up to about 40 Hz.\n\n**Minor Issues:** None observed. The axis labels are clear, the title is informative, and the plot is well-formatted.\n\n**Major Issues:** None observed. This appears to be a reasonable distribution for neural firing rates.\n\n## Figure 2: Unit Quality: SNR vs Presence Ratio\n**Overview:**\nThis scatter plot examines unit quality metrics, with Presence Ratio on the x-axis (ranging from 0-1) and Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) on the y-axis. Each dot represents one neural unit. The plot shows most units clustered with presence ratios between 0.7-1.0, with a few having higher SNR values (up to 75).\n\n**Minor Issues:** None observed. The plot is well-labeled and clearly presents the relationship between these quality metrics.\n\n**Major Issues:** None observed. The relationship shown is biologically plausible, with higher presence ratios generally corresponding to higher SNRs.\n\n## Figure 3: Mouse Running Speed\n**Overview:**\nThis line plot shows the mouse's running speed (y-axis, in cm/s) over time (x-axis, in seconds) for the entire 8000-second recording session. The plot shows clear alternating periods of running (speeds around 15 cm/s) and rest (speeds near 0 cm/s), reflecting the typical behavior of a mouse on a running wheel.\n\n**Minor Issues:** None observed. The plot is clearly labeled and well-formatted.\n\n**Major Issues:** None observed. The pattern of running and rest shown is biologically plausible for a mouse.\n\n## Figure 4: Distribution of Running Speeds\n**Overview:**\nThis histogram shows the distribution of running speeds across the entire recording. The distribution is bimodal, with one peak at very low speeds (0-1 cm/s, representing periods of rest) and another peak at around 15 cm/s (representing periods of active running).\n\n**Minor Issues:** None observed. The plot is well-labeled and clearly shows the bimodal distribution.\n\n**Major Issues:** None observed. The bimodal distribution accurately reflects the alternating behaviors seen in the time-series plot.\n\n## Figure 5: Timing of SAC_Wd15_Vel2_Bndry1_Cntst0_loop Presentations\n**Overview:**\nThis plot shows the timing of the first 50 presentations of a specific visual stimulus. Each horizontal line represents one stimulus presentation, with its x-position indicating the start and end times. The plot shows that stimuli were presented sequentially with short gaps between presentations.\n\n**Minor Issues:** None observed. The plot effectively visualizes the timing of stimulus presentations.\n\n**Major Issues:** None observed. The pattern of regular stimulus presentations with small gaps is typical for visual neuroscience experiments.\n\n## Figure 6: Neural Activity and Running Speed\n**Overview:**\nThis figure contains two aligned plots. The top plot is a raster plot showing spike times for 20 neural units (y-axis) over a 100-second period (x-axis). The bottom plot shows the mouse's running speed during the same time period. This allows for direct comparison between neural activity and running behavior.\n\n**Minor Issues:** None observed. Both plots are well-labeled, and having them aligned on the same time axis effectively visualizes potential relationships.\n\n**Major Issues:** None observed. The data shows that the mouse starts running around the 1060-second mark, which provides an opportunity to examine how neural activity might change with running behavior.\n\n## Figure 7: Eye Position over Time\n**Overview:**\nThis figure contains two plots showing the x-position (top) and y-position (bottom) of the mouse's eye over the entire 8000-second recording. The plots show gradual shifts in eye position with occasional rapid movements (saccades).\n\n**Minor Issues:** None observed. Both plots are well-labeled and aligned on the same time axis.\n\n**Major Issues:** None observed. The eye movement patterns appear biologically plausible, showing periods of stability with occasional saccades.\n\n## Figure 8: Eye Position Trajectory\n**Overview:**\nThis scatter plot shows the x-position (x-axis) and y-position (y-axis) of the eye, effectively visualizing the eye's trajectory and areas of focus. The clusters of points represent regions where the eye dwelled for longer periods.\n\n**Minor Issues:** None observed. The plot has equal axes, appropriate axis labels, and a clear title.\n\n**Major Issues:** None observed. The clustering pattern is typical for eye tracking data, showing preferred fixation locations.\n\n## Figure 9: LFP Traces\n**Overview:**\nThis plot shows simulated Local Field Potential (LFP) traces from multiple recording channels over a 2-second period. Each horizontal trace represents data from one channel, with successive traces offset vertically for clarity. The traces show clear oscillatory patterns.\n\n**Minor Issues:** None observed. The plot effectively visualizes multi-channel LFP data.\n\n**Major Issues:** None observed. The simulated data shows realistic oscillatory patterns typical of LFP recordings.\n\n## Figure 10: Unit Response to a Single Stimulus\n**Overview:**\nThis bar plot shows a Peri-Stimulus Time Histogram (PSTH) for a single neural unit in response to a specific visual stimulus. The x-axis shows time relative to stimulus onset (marked by the vertical dashed red line), and the y-axis shows firing rate. The plot reveals an increase in firing rate shortly after stimulus presentation.\n\n**Minor Issues:** None observed. The plot clearly shows the neural response relative to stimulus onset.\n\n**Major Issues:** None observed. The response pattern (increased firing following stimulus onset) is biologically plausible.\n\n## Figure 11: Unit Response to Different Stimulus Types\n**Overview:**\nThis line plot compares a neural unit's responses to four different stimulus types. Each line represents the PSTH for a different stimulus, with time relative to stimulus onset on the x-axis and firing rate on the y-axis. The plot shows that the unit responds differently to each stimulus type, with varying response latencies and amplitudes.\n\n**Minor Issues:** None observed. The plot effectively compares responses across stimulus types with clear labeling.\n\n**Major Issues:** None observed. The different response patterns to different stimuli are biologically plausible and demonstrate stimulus selectivity.",
