  "image_descriptions": "I'll provide a detailed description of the two images in the notebook:\n\n### Figure 1: Corneal Reflection Tracking Data (First 1000 Samples)\n\n**Overview:**\nThis figure shows the X and Y coordinates of corneal reflection tracking data over time. The X coordinate is plotted in blue and the Y coordinate in orange. The data spans approximately 15-31 seconds of recording time. The X coordinate values range roughly between 360-380 meters, while the Y coordinate values are around 260-270 meters, with a notable spike around the 22.5 second mark.\n\n**Minor Issues:**\n- The Y-axis label indicates \"Position (meters)\" which seems unusually large for eye tracking measurements (typically in mm or cm). This might be an issue with units not being properly converted.\n- The data appears somewhat noisy with several small jumps.\n\n**Major Issues:**\n- No major issues with the visualization itself, though the absolute values (in meters) suggest these might not be calibrated eye positions but rather raw camera pixel values or uncalibrated measurements.\n\n### Figure 2: Running Speed Data (First 1000 Samples)\n\n**Overview:**\nThis figure displays the animal's running speed measured in centimeters per second (cm/s) over a time period from approximately 113-138 seconds. The plot shows several periods of activity where the speed fluctuates, with peaks reaching around 15 cm/s and dips going as low as -9 cm/s. There are also periods of inactivity where the speed remains at or near 0 cm/s.\n\n**Minor Issues:**\n- The presence of negative running speeds is somewhat counterintuitive as running speed is typically represented as a positive value. This likely represents backward movement or deceleration, but might need clarification.\n\n**Major Issues:**\n- The data shows some extreme spikes (like the one at approximately 120 seconds reaching -9 cm/s and then immediately jumping to +15 cm/s). These rapid, large changes in speed might represent actual behavior, but could also potentially be artifacts in the recording that would need validation.\n\nBoth figures are well-structured with proper titles, axis labels, and legends. They provide a good initial visualization of the eye tracking and running data available in this dataset.",
