  "image_descriptions": "I'll provide a detailed description of each of the three visualization figures in the notebook:\n\n### Figure 1: Eye Tracking Data\n**Overview:**\nThis figure shows eye tracking data with two lines: a blue line representing X position and an orange line representing Y position of the eye. The data spans approximately 15-31 seconds, showing the first 1000 data points of the eye tracking measurements. The y-axis represents position in meters, and the x-axis represents time in seconds.\n\n**Minor issues:**\n- The units on the y-axis indicate \"meters,\" but the values (ranging from about 225 to 375) seem unusually large for eye positions measured in meters. This suggests there might be a unit conversion issue or that these are pixels or some other unit rather than actual meters.\n- The plot would benefit from grid lines to make it easier to read precise values.\n\n**Major issues:**\n- There are some dramatic vertical drops in the data (particularly around 20s and 22.5s) that appear to be artifacts or outliers, which could represent blinks or tracking errors rather than actual eye movements.\n- Without context about what the subject was viewing or doing, it's difficult to interpret what these eye movements represent.\n\n### Figure 2: Running Speed Data\n**Overview:**\nThis figure displays running speed data over time, with speed measured in cm/s on the y-axis and time in seconds on the x-axis. The data spans approximately 0-7000 seconds (nearly 2 hours), showing the complete running behavior during the recording session.\n\n**Minor issues:**\n- The x-axis might benefit from being displayed in minutes or hours given the long duration.\n- The dense nature of the plot makes it difficult to see details in specific regions.\n\n**Major issues:**\n- There are negative running speed values (down to about -20 cm/s), which is physically impossible for running speed (though this could represent direction of movement on a wheel).\n- There's an unusually large spike around 5600-5800 seconds that reaches approximately 65 cm/s, which stands out and may warrant investigation.\n- The data appears somewhat noisy, with rapid fluctuations between positive and negative values.\n\n### Figure 3: Stimulus Timestamps\n**Overview:**\nThis figure shows stimulus timestamps plotted as dots at y=0, with time in seconds on the x-axis. The data spans approximately 0-7000 seconds, matching the timeframe of the running speed data.\n\n**Minor issues:**\n- The y-axis range (-0.04 to 0.04) doesn't provide any meaningful information since all points are plotted at y=0.\n- The markers are densely packed, making it difficult to distinguish individual stimulus events.\n\n**Major issues:**\n- The visualization doesn't convey much information about the nature of the stimuli, their duration, or their type.\n- A more informative approach might be to use different markers or colors for different stimulus types, or to show stimulus onsets and durations.\n- The dense, uniform appearance makes it hard to identify patterns or relationships with the other measured parameters.\n\nOverall, while these figures provide a basic visualization of the data, they would benefit from additional context, better labeling, and more sophisticated visualization approaches to reveal patterns in the data.",
