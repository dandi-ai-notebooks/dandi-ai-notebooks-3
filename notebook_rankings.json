Inaccurate units (eye position in \"meters\")\n2. Questionable axis labels\n3. Unaddressed outliers in response time data\n\nWhile these issues could lead to misinterpretations, they don't significantly impact the notebook's educational value in showing how to access and work with the dataset. The visualizations are limited but functional.\n</thinking>\n<notebook_id>2025-04-17-gemini-2.0-flash-001-prompt-b-5</notebook_id>\n<rank>4</rank>\n</notebook>\n\n<notebook>\n<thinking>\nThis notebook provides a basic introduction to Dandiset 001275, demonstrating how to connect to the DANDI archive, load an NWB file, and create simple visualizations of eye and hand position data.\n\nThe issues are relatively minor:\n1. Limited time window in visualizations (less than 100 seconds)\n2. Unclear units in hand position plot\n3. Limited scope - doesn't explore the neurophysiology data\n\nThis notebook is more limited in scope than others, focusing only on behavioral data and providing just two time-series plots. However, it's well-structured, follows a logical progression, and correctly implements the basic functionality of accessing and visualizing DANDI data. It provides a solid foundation but lacks the depth of exploration seen in higher-ranked notebooks.\n</thinking>\n<notebook_id>2025-04-17-gpt-4o-prompt-b-5</notebook_id>\n<rank>5</rank>\n</notebook>\n\n<notebook>\n<thinking>\nThis notebook provides a minimal introduction to Dandiset 001275. It demonstrates how to access the DANDI Archive, load an NWB file, extract metadata, and create a simple visualization of eye position data.\n\nWhile the notebook is error-free and achieves its stated goal of introducing the dataset, its scope is extremely limited compared to the other notebooks. It includes only a single visualization (eye position time series) and doesn't explore any of the neural data or trial structure that are central to the dataset's purpose.\n\nThe notebook is well-structured and error-free, but its minimal scope and lack of in-depth exploration make it less valuable for users wanting to understand the full capabilities of the dataset.\n</thinking>\n<notebook_id>2025-04-17-gpt-4o-prompt-a-5</notebook_id>\n<rank>6</rank>\n</notebook>",
