It demonstrates proper use of the DANDI API for efficiently accessing data remotely without full downloads. The notebook covers basic session metadata, imaging device properties, raw calcium imaging visualization, ROI identification, fluorescence trace visualization, and attempts at event detection and correlation analysis.\n\nWhile the notebook is well-structured, there are some visualization issues (non-uniform illumination, ROI mask indexing error, shape mismatch) and analysis limitations (unsuccessful event detection, missing correlations between ROIs, unaddressed sampling rate differences). The code has some inconsistencies, but overall handles potential failures gracefully.\n\nThe notebook provides users with a good understanding of accessing and visualizing calcium imaging data from DANDI, with a clear path for future analyses."
