Most trials appear to clustered between 0 and 20 seconds, with some trials having durations between 20 and 40 seconds. There are a couple of trials even longer.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The histogram shows the distribution of trial durations. The x-axis is labeled "Duration (seconds)" and the y-axis is labeled "Frequency." The histogram is heavily skewed to the right, with the majority of trials having short durations (less than 20 seconds). A few trials have much longer durations, extending to nearly 170 seconds.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 32
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell extracts a small segment (0.1 seconds) of raw electrophysiological data from the loaded NWB file. It selects the first four channels and plots their amplitudes over time. To improve readability, each channel's signal is offset vertically by a fixed amount. The plot displays time on the x-axis and amplitude (with offset) on the y-axis. The sampling rate and shape of the data is printed before the short segment is extracted and plotted.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The plot shows the raw electrophysiology signal for four channels (0, 1, 2, and 3) over a 0.1-second window of time. The x-axis is labeled "Time (s)", ranging from 100.00 to 100.10 seconds. The y-axis is labeled "Amplitude (μV) + offset." Each channel's signal is plotted with a different color and offset vertically for clarity. The signals appear noisy, with some shared fluctuations between channels.

OVERVIEW:
This cell compares raw electrophysiological signals from different electrode groups (shanks). It retrieves the electrode IDs for shank1 and shank2, selects the first three electrodes from each shank, and plots their raw data over time. The signals are offset vertically for better visualization.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The plot displays the raw signals from different electrode groups (shanks). The x-axis represents "Time (s)," ranging from 100.00 to 100.10 seconds. The y-axis represents "Amplitude (μV) + offset." The plot shows overlaid signals for 3 channels from each of shank 1, and shank 2. The legend specifies "Shank1-0", "Shank1-1", "Shank1-2", and "Shank2-128", "Shank2-129", "Shank2-130" corresponding to the first three electrode ids from each shank. The signals appear noisy with an apparent large deflection downward around 100.03 seconds.

ISSUES:
None

Cell 35
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell provides an interpretation of the raw electrophysiological data and compares signals from different electrode groups (shanks). It notes the presence of high-frequency oscillations, varying amplitudes, and both slow and fast activity. It suggests that the different patterns observed in the signals from different channels may indicate recordings from different neural populations or brain regions. It also mentions the need for further analysis to confirm this hypothesis.

Cell 39
==========

OVERVIEW:

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 40
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell calculates statistics for each unit in the dataset. For each unit, it accesses its spike times, computes the number of spikes, mean firing rate, inter-spike intervals (ISIs), mean ISI, and coefficient of variation of ISIs (CV ISI). It stores these statistics in a list of dictionaries, then converts this list to a Pandas DataFrame named `unit_stats_df`. Finally, it prints the average, minimum, and maximum spike rates across all units. The code uses the index `i` to get the spike times and unit id to store the stats, instead of the unit_id stored in the `units_df.index`, ensuring that the correct unit index is being used to get the `spike_times`.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 41
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell generates a histogram showing the distribution of mean spike rates across all units. The x-axis represents the mean spike rate in Hertz (Hz), and the y-axis represents the number of units.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The histogram shows the distribution of mean spike rates across units. The x-axis is labeled "Mean Spike Rate (Hz)" and the y-axis is labeled "Number of Units." The distribution is right skewed, with most units having low mean spike rates. The data suggests units are most commonly firing at around 2-8 Hz. The rate tapers off, but there appears to be one unit with a mean spike rate as high as 58 Hz.

ISSUES:
None

ISSUES:

Cell 43
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell generates a scatter plot showing the relationship between each unit's mean spike rate and the coefficient of variation (CV) of its inter-spike intervals (ISIs). It filters out units with NaN values in the 'cv_isi' column. The x-axis represents the mean spike rate (Hz), and the y-axis represents the CV of ISI.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The scatter plot displays the relationship between the mean spike rate and the coefficient of variation of ISI for the recorded units. The x-axis represents the "Mean Spike Rate (Hz)", ranging from 0 to 60 Hz. The y-axis represents the "Coefficient of Variation of ISI", ranging from 0 to 3.5. Most data points are clustered at lower spike rates (below 20 Hz). There is no clear relationship, but the CV of ISI values appear more scattered at lower mean spike rates than higher spike rates.

ISSUES:
None

Cell 44
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell summarizes the key findings from the single-unit activity analysis. It describes:
1. The range of firing rates observed across units, noting that most units have firing rates below 20 Hz.
2. The relationship between firing rate and regularity (CV of ISI), noting that at lower firing rates, there is a wider range of CV values, and that there are too few high-firing rate units to make any conclusions.

Cell 46
==========

OVERVIEW:

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 47
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell analyzes the spiking activity of selected units around the start and end of selected trials. It selects the top three units with the highest mean firing rates and the first five trials. For each unit and trial, it identifies spikes that occur within a 2-second window around the start of the trial, calculates the time of theses spikes relative to the trial-start, and plots these spikes as vertical lines on a scatter plot. Each row in the plot corresponds to a unique unit-trial combination. The normalized time relative to trial start is on the x axis. Vertical red and green lines mark the start and end times of the trial.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The plot shows the spike activity of three selected units around the start and end times of five selected trials. The x-axis represents "Time Relative to Trial Start (s)", ranging from approximately -2.5 to 15. The y-axis represents different combinations of units and trials, labeled as "U[unit_id]-T[trial_id]". Each spike is marked as a small vertical line. The start of each trial (time 0) is marked by a vertical dashed red line, while the end of each trial is marked by a vertical dashed green line. The varying density and temporal distribution of spikes within and across the trials and units suggest differences in trial-related activity.

ISSUES:
None

Cell 48
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell provides an interpretation of the trial-aligned spike raster plot generated in the previous cell. It notes that the spike patterns are relatively consistent throughout the trials and that the trial boundaries don't seem to strongly modulate the spiking behavior. It also observes that different units exhibit distinct firing patterns.

Cell 51
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell compares data from two different sessions (MS13B and MS14A).

Cell 52
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell generates a histogram comparing the distributions of trial durations between the two sessions (MS13B and MS14A). It plots the histograms with some transparency to allow for visual comparison. It also includes a legend indicating the session label and the number of trials. The file handles for the second session are closed.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The plot shows the distribution of trial durations for two sessions, MS13B and MS14A. A blue histogram represents MS13B (387 trials), and an orange histogram represents MS14A (716 trials). The x-axis is labeled "Trial Duration (seconds)," and the y-axis is labeled "Frequency." Both distributions are right-skewed, with the majority of trials having short durations, but MS13B has a longer-tailed distribution, with some trials well beyond 20 seconds. MS14A appears to have almost all trials under 20 seconds.
