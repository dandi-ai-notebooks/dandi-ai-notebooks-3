It stores these statistics in a list of dictionaries, then converts this list to a Pandas DataFrame named `unit_stats_df`. Finally, it prints the average, minimum, and maximum spike rates across all units. The code uses the index `i` to get the spike times and unit id to store the stats, instead of the unit_id stored in the `units_df.index`, ensuring that the correct unit index is being used to get the `spike_times`.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",

It selects the top three units with the highest mean firing rates and the first five trials. For each unit and trial, it identifies spikes that occur within a 2-second window around the start of the trial, calculates the time of theses spikes relative to the trial-start, and plots these spikes as vertical lines on a scatter plot. Each row in the plot corresponds to a unique unit-trial combination. The normalized time relative to trial start is on the x axis. Vertical red and green lines mark the start and end times of the trial.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe plot shows the spike activity of three selected units around the start and end times of five selected trials. The x-axis represents \"Time Relative to Trial Start (s)\", ranging from approximately -2.5 to 15. The y-axis represents different combinations of units and trials, labeled as \"U[unit_id]-T[trial_id]\". Each spike is marked as a small vertical line. The start of each trial (time 0) is marked by a vertical dashed red line, while the end of each trial is marked by a vertical dashed green line. The varying density and temporal distribution of spikes within and across the trials and units suggest differences in trial-related activity.\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
