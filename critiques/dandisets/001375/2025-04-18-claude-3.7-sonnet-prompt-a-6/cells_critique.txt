IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 8
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell loads and explores an NWB file from the DANDI archive. It selects the NWB file associated with subject MS13B, constructs the download URL using a hardcoded asset ID, opens the file using `remfile` and `h5py`, then reads it using `pynwb`. Finally, it prints basic information about the NWB file, including the session description, identifier, session start time, and file creation date. The warning about namespace version mismatch is also displayed.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
The asset ID is currently hardcoded. While it accomplishes the immediate goal, it reduces the reusability and robustness of the notebook. It would be more robust to programmatically determine the asset ID. Despite the warning message regarding namespace version mismatch, the cell still functions correctly and provides the requested information.

None

Cell 21
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell generates a raster plot of spike times for a subset of neural units. It defines a function to retrieve spike times for a given unit ID. It selects the first 5 units, retrieves their spike times, and plots them as vertical lines on a raster plot. The x-axis represents time, and the y-axis represents the unit number. The plot displays the firing pattern of each unit over time, and the x-axis is limited to the 100-200 second timeframe for better visualization.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The plot is a spike raster plot showing the activity of 5 selected units. The x-axis represents time in seconds, ranging from 100 to 200. The y-axis represents the unit number, labeled Unit 0 through Unit 4. Each vertical line represents a spike event for a given unit at a specific time. The unit at level 'Unit 2' appears to be constantly spiking across the interval.

ISSUES:
None

Cell 22
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell introduces the calculation and visualization of firing rates for the neural units.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 23
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell calculates and visualizes the average firing rates of all units. It iterates through each unit, retrieves the spike times, calculates the firing rate (number of spikes divided by the total recording time, using the end time of the last trial), and stores the firing rate and unit ID. It then generates a bar plot showing the average firing rate for each unit.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The plot is a bar graph displaying the "Average Firing Rates of All Units." The x-axis represents "Unit ID," ranging from 0 to approximately 32. The y-axis represents "Firing Rate (Hz)," ranging from 0 to 60 Hz. Each bar corresponds to a unit, with the height of the bar indicating the average firing rate of that unit. The firing rates vary considerably across the units, with some units having very low firing rates (close to 0 Hz) and others having much higher firing rates (up to nearly 60 Hz).

ISSUES:
None

Cell 24
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell introduces the exploration of how neural activity relates to behavior (trials).

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 25
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell explores the relationship between neural activity (spiking) and behavior (trials). It first selects a single unit (unit 0) to analyze. It defines a function to identify spikes occurring within a given trial. Then, it calculates the spike count and firing rate for the selected unit during each trial. These values are added as new columns to the `trials_df` DataFrame. Two plots are generated: one showing the spike count per trial, and another showing the firing rate per trial, both plotted against trial number. Lastly, a scatter plot examines the relationship between trial duration and firing rate.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The first figure contains 2 subplots that share an x axis. The x-axis of both is titled "Trial Number" and it ranges from 0 to 400.

The first subplot is titled "Unit 0 - Spike Count per Trial." The y-axis is labeled "Spike Count". Values range from 0 to about 450. Data is plotted as blue points connected by blue lines. There is one prominent data point at roughly trial number 225 with a spike count over 400. Other data points appear to be in a range from 0 - 100.

The second subplot is titled "Unit 0 - Firing Rate per Trial". The y-axis is labeled "Firing Rate (Hz)" and the values range from 0 to 14 Hz. Data is plotted as red points connected by red lines. There are many peaks and valleys of neural activity.

The second figure is a scatter plot with the title "Unit 0 - Firing Rate vs. Trial Duration.". The x-axis is labeled "Trial duration (s)", with values ranging from 0-160. The y-axis is again "Firing Rate (Hz)". It plots blue points that show a general cluster of high spiking activity occurring in short duration trials.

ISSUES:
None

Cell 26

OVERVIEW:
This cell introduces the idea of combining multiple units' activity for advanced visualization.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 27
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell creates a more complex visualization, showing the spiking activity of multiple units across selected trials. It selects the first 5 trials and the first 5 units. For each trial and unit combination, it retrieves spike times, filters the spikes to include only those occurring within the trial, normalizes the spike times to the trial's start time, and plots the spikes. Trial boundaries are marked with horizontal lines, and each trial is labeled on the left. The plot displays each unit's normalized spiking activity in relation to the start of the trial.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The plot is a raster plot that shows spike times across multiple trials and units. The x-axis is labeled "Time from Trial Start (s)" and ranges from -0.5 to 10. The y-axis has no tick marks, but the y-axis is organized by trials. Thin grey dashed lines run horizontally to separate each trial. Each of the 5 trials are labeled on the left side of the plot. Trial 0 is the bottom subplot. Within each trial, there are 5 units with spiking activity represented. Each color represents data from separate distinct trials.

ISSUES:
None
