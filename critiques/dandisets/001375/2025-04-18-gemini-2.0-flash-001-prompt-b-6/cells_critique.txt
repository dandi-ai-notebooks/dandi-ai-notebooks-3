Cell 1
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell introduces the notebook's purpose, which is to explore Dandiset 001375, detailing the effect of disrupting septal GABAergic activity on hippocampal and neocortical activity. It provides a brief overview of the topics covered in the notebook and lists the required Python packages. It then proceeds to load the Dandiset metadata using the DANDI API, prints basic information such as the Dandiset name and URL, lists the assets within the Dandiset, and prints the names of the first 5 assets. This cell sets the stage for subsequent data loading and visualization.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None


Cell 2
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell introduces the section on loading data from a specific NWB file within the Dandiset. It specifies the NWB file name that will be used and notes that the URL for the asset will be shown.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None


Cell 3
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell loads the NWB file specified in the previous cell using `pynwb`, `h5py`, and `remfile`. First, the URL for the asset is defined. Then, it opens the remote file using `remfile.File`, reads it using `h5py.File`, and finally loads the NWB data structure using `pynwb.NWBHDF5IO`.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
The UserWarning from hdmf is not ideal, but likely ignorable. It does suggest a potential versioning conflict between 'core' namespaces. It does not seem to impact the loading of the data, but it is something to keep in mind.

Cell 4
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell introduces the section focusing on visualizing electrode locations extracted from the loaded NWB file.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None


Cell 5
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell extracts electrode locations (x and y coordinates) from the loaded NWB file and generates a scatter plot visualizing these locations.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image shows a scatter plot of "Electrode Locations". The x-axis is labeled "Electrode X Location" and the y-axis is labeled "Electrode Y Location". There are three distinct vertical clusters of data points. Two clusters are located at approximately x = -20 and x=20 and extend from y = approximately 100 to y = approximately 2100. The third vertical cluster is centered around x = 0 and spans a similar range along the y-axis. There are also two lone data points at around x = -15 and x = 17, both at approximately y = 100.

ISSUES:
None

Cell 6
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell provides a brief description of the pattern observed in the electrode locations plot.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:

ISSUES:
None

Cell 7
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell introduces the section for plotting raw data, specifically from channel 0.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 8
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell retrieves raw data from the loaded NWB file, specifically the first 1000 data points from channel 0. It calculates corresponding timestamps using the sampling rate from the NWB file. Finally, it generates a line plot of the raw data against time.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image displays a line plot of "Raw Data from Channel 0." The x-axis represents "Time (s)" ranging from approximately 0 to 0.035 seconds, and the y-axis represents "Voltage (mV)" ranging from approximately -750 to 1000 mV. The plot shows a fluctuating voltage signal over time. There are fast oscillations superimposed on slower changes, with one prominent negative deflection around 0.018 seconds and prominent positive deflections at the beginning and end of the period.

ISSUES:
The assumption `nwb.acquisition["time_series"].rate` seems reasonable but it would be safer practice to be more specific, i.e. retrieve the time_series object and then access its rate. Specifically the key "time_series" is vague, it would be more precise to key into the actual name of the time_series found in the NWB file.

Cell 9
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell provides a brief interpretation of the raw data plot, noting the fluctuating voltage and characterizing it as a noisy signal.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 10
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell sets up the section for visualizing trial start and stop times from the NWB file.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 11
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell extracts trial start and stop times from the NWB file and visualizes them using an event plot. The plot displays trial start times in blue and stop times in red, allowing for a visual representation of the trial structure.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image displays an event plot titled "Trial Start and Stop Times." The x-axis is labeled "Time (s)" ranging from 0 to approximately 5000. The y-axis is labeled "Trials". Blue vertical lines indicate trial start times, and red vertical lines indicate trial stop times. The blue lines appear almost superimposed on the y-axis. A solid series of red lines appears immediately after the blue set, which gives way to a period of no starts or stops, then another series of start/stop with short duration. A legend distinguishes "Start Time" (blue) from "Stop Time" (red).

ISSUES:
The y-axis label "Trials" is misleading. Event plots don't typically have a quantitative y-axis in this way. Each event (start or stop) is plotted at a certain "height" but the height is meaningless. This plot would be more informative if the trial IDs/numbers were labeled on the y axis, showing sequential trials. As is, this is useful to see how trials are structured in general but not specific trials.

Cell 12
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell provides a concise interpretation of the trial start and stop times plot, commenting on the clustering and implying short trial durations.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 13
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell summarizes the notebook's content and accomplished goals, and proposes directions for further exploration and analysis. It recaps the steps taken: loading metadata, listing assets, and visualizing electrode locations, raw data, and trial times. It suggests analyzing other datasets, performing advanced signal processing, and investigating the relationship between electrodes and neural activity.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
