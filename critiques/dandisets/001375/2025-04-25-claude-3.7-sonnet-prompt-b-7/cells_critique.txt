Cell 15
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell analyzes and visualizes the trial structure of the experiment. It converts the `nwb.trials` object to a Pandas DataFrame and prints its length, along with the first 5 rows. It calculates the duration of each trial and computes descriptive statistics (mean, median, min, max, standard deviation) of the trial durations, printing these statistics to the console. Finally, it generates and displays a histogram of the trial durations using Matplotlib, with labeled axes and a title.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image is a histogram displaying the distribution of trial durations. The x-axis represents 'Duration (seconds),' and the y-axis represents 'Count' (number of trials). The histogram shows the frequency of different trial durations, with most trials concentrated in the lower range (0-20 seconds); the distribution is heavily skewed to the right, with a long tail extending towards longer durations.

ISSUES:
None

Cell 18
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell explores the neural unit data. It converts the `nwb.units` table into a Pandas DataFrame. It defines a function `get_spike_times` to extract the spike times of a given unit and then calculates the firing rate for each unit by dividing the spike count by total duration of the recording. It stores this information in a list and converts it to a Pandas DataFrame. The units are sorted in descending order by spike count. The top 5 and bottom 5 units (based on spike count) are then printed. Finally, a histogram is plotted showing the distribution of firing rates across all units.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image is a histogram displaying the distribution of unit firing rates. The x-axis represents 'Firing Rate (Hz),' and the y-axis represents 'Count' (number of units). The histogram shows the frequency of different firing rates among the recorded neurons, with the majority of units clustered at lower firing rates (below 10 Hz). The distribution shows positive skew.

ISSUES:
None

Cell 19
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell provides interpretation of the firing rate distribution of the neural units, stating that most units have low firing rates (below 20 Hz) and a smaller subset exhibit much higher firing rates. It suggests that this distribution shape is normal in extracellular recordings, where inhibitory interneurons often have higher firing rates than excitatory neurons.

ISSUES:
None

Cell 21
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell generates and displays a spike raster plot for the top 5 most active units. It selects the unit IDs of the top 5 units based on spike count from the `unit_df` DataFrame and finds their corresponding indices in the `units.id` array. It then iterates through these indices, extracting the spike times for each unit and plotting them as vertical lines against time. To improve the visualization, the spike times are limited to the first 200 seconds of the recording. The plot includes labeled axes, unit numbers on the y-axis, a title, and a grid.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image is a spike raster plot showing the firing patterns of the top 5 most active units over the first 200 seconds of recording. The x-axis represents 'Time (seconds)', and the y-axis represents 'Unit Number'. Each horizontal line represents a single neuron (unit), and vertical ticks along each line mark the times when that neuron fired an action potential (spike). The units are labeled "Unit [unit ID]". The high density of vertical ticks reveals which units fire more often.

ISSUES:
None

Cell 22

ISSUES:
None

Cell 24
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell performs inter-spike interval (ISI) analysis for the most active unit. It retrieves the spike times for the most active neuron. It calculates the ISIs by finding the differences between consecutive spike times. Then, it creates a histogram of the ISIs, but only showing intervals less than 0.5 seconds to focus on typical intervals and exclude very long pauses. The plot has appropriate axes labels, a descriptive title, and a grid for clarity.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image is a histogram displaying the distribution of inter-spike intervals (ISIs) for the most active unit (Unit 3). The x-axis represents 'Inter-spike Interval (seconds)', and shows values up to 0.5 seconds. The y-axis represents 'Count'. The histogram shows the frequency of occurrence of different ISI durations. The distribution is heavily skewed to the right, with the vast majority of ISIs falling close to zero and decreasing rapidly as the interval increases.

ISSUES:
None

Cell 26
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell introduces examining the relationship between neural activity and behavior by using peri-event time histograms (PETHs).

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 27
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell creates peri-event time histograms (PETHs) to analyze the relationship between neural activity and trial starts. It defines a function `create_peth` that computes the average firing rate of neurons around the time of specific events. Then, the code retrieves the start times for the first 50 trials. After, it identifies the high, medium, and low firing units by sorting their spike counts. The PETH is then computed for each of these units, using the trial start times as the events. Finally, a time series plot is generated for each unit depicting firing rate relative to trial start time. Each subplot shows firing rate (Hz) over time relative to trial start, with a vertical line at time 0 representing the trial start.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image contains three bar plots, each representing a peri-event time histogram (PETH) for a selected unit (high, medium, and low firing). In each plot:
- The x-axis represents the time relative to the trial start (in seconds) from -1 to 3.
- The y-axis represents the firing rate in Hz.
- A vertical dashed red line indicates the time of the trial start (time 0).
- The bars depict the average firing rate of the unit in each time bin around the trial start.
The top plot displays Unit 3, which exhibits a consistently high firing rate before, during, and after the trial start. The middle plot, Unit 5, has a firing rate that fluctuates and seems to increase post trial start. The bottom plot displays Unit 18 which has a low firing rate overall.

ISSUES:
None

Cell 28
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell provides an interpretation of the peri-event time histograms (PETHs) created in the previous cell. It describes observed activity patterns with respect to trial start:

*   **High-firing unit:** slight increase in activity shortly after the trial start
*   **Medium-firing unit:** a brief spike in activity around 0.5 seconds after the trial start
*   **Low-firing unit:** more delayed activity, increasing gradually after the trial start

It also suggests that these different patterns might reflect different roles of these neurons in the behavioral paradigm.

Cell 30
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell creates and displays a spike raster plot for the high-firing unit (Unit 3), aligned to the start of the first 20 trials. For each trial, it identifies the spikes that occur within a window of -1 to 3 seconds relative to the trial start. These spikes are then plotted as vertical lines, with the x-position corresponding to the aligned time and the y-position indicating the trial number. A vertical line at x = 0 marks the trial start.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image is a a spike raster plot. The X axis is labeled 'Time Relative to Trial Start (seconds), going from -1 to 3 s. The Y-axis is labeled 'Trial Number', going from 0 to 19. A dashed red vertical line goes the full height of the plot at 0, labeled 'Trial Start'. The plot is quite dense; vertical blue lines mark the occurrence of spikes.

ISSUES:
None

==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell interprets the trial-aligned spike raster plot for the high-firing unit. The interpretation states that the plot suggests a consistent response pattern across trials, with slightly more spiking after trial start, and the consistently suggests a reliable neural response.

ISSUES:
None

Cell 33
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell explores the raw electrophysiology data. It retrieves the time series data and prints its shape, sampling rate, unit, and total duration. It extracts a short segment (0.1 second) to avoid excessive memory usage when loading remote data. It selects two random channels from each shank of the recording probe. It generates a time vector based off the sample rate. Finally, it plots the raw signal from each of the four selected channels over the 0.1-second window. The plots are arranged in a 4x1 grid, and each subplot displays the voltage (mV) over time.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image consists of four line plots, each representing the raw electrophysiology signal from a single channel over a 0.1-second time period. Each plot has the following properties:

*   X-axis: Time (seconds), ranging from 0 to 0.1
*   Y-axis: Voltage (mV)
*   Title: Indicates the channel number and the shank it belongs to (either Shank 1 or Shank 2).
*   The signal voltage fluctuates. Several spikes are apparent in the top two channels. The bottom two channels on shank 2 show slow drift and possibly saturation toward the end of the 0.1 second window.

ISSUES:
None

Cell 34
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell provides an interpretation of the raw electrophysiology data plots.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 36
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell calculates and plots the power spectra for the four selected channels. For each channel, it calculates the power spectrum using the fast Fourier transform (`np.fft.rfft`). It then plots the power spectrum against frequency, using a log-log scale. Each subplot is labeled with the channel number and its corresponding shank, and includes a grid.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image consists of four line plots stacked vertically. Each plot displays the power spectrum (power vs. frequency) for a single channel, and each plot shares a linear x-axis and y-axis. The channels correspond to the same ones displayed in the previous cell (two from shank 1 and two from shank 2), which are labeled with the channel number and shank location as the title. The X-axis is labeled Frequency (Hz), has a log scale, and ranges from roughly 10 to the 3rd power. The y axis is labeled power, has a log scale, and ranges from roughly 10 to the 10th power to roughly 10 to the 14th power. The two plots from shank 1 appear more similar to each other than the bottom two from shank 2, and all three appear to have more power at lower frequencies than at high frequencies. All subplots are line plots.

ISSUES:
None

Cell 37
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell provides an interpretation of the power spectra plots generated in the previous cell. It notes that all channels exhibit the highest power in the low-frequency bands (0.5-10 Hz). It also notes differences between shanks: shank 1 shows oscillatory activity between 10-30 Hz, whereas shank 2 exhibits a more gradual power decline.

Cell 39
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell aims to visualize the overall relationship between neural activity and the trial structure, focusing on the high-firing unit. It first retrieves the spike times for the most active unit ("high_firing_idx"). Next, it creates a histogram of the spike times within 1-second bins for the first 800 seconds of the recording and plots the spike counts over time. Finally, in a subplot, it plots the timing of the trials, the trials are indicated as vertical spans between the start and stop times.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image contains two subplots stacked vertically representing a comparison between the spiking behavior of a single neuron and trial timing. The top plot shows the spike counts in one-second bins vs time for the high-firing unit. The y-axis is labeled "Spike Count (per second)" and shows some variation of the spike counts over time. The plot starts at 0 and ends at 800 seconds. The bottom plot shows the trial timing. Each trial is represented by a vertical gray bar that stretches between the trial onset and offset.
