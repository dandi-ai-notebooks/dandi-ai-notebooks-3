    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell serves as the title and introductory section of the notebook. It identifies the specific Dandiset being explored (001375) and mentions the experimental focus: the disruption of GABA in the septum using DREADDs. Most importantly, it includes a disclaimer that the notebook was AI-generated and may contain errors, advising users to be cautious. This disclaimer is crucial for responsible use of the notebook.\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell provides a brief overview of the Dandiset 001375, including its title and the experimental question it addresses (disrupting septal GABAergic activity and its effects). It explicitly states the license (CC-BY-4.0) and provides a direct link to the Dandiset page on the DANDI Archive.\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell outlines the key objectives of the notebook, providing a roadmap for the user. It lists the main steps involved in exploring the Dandiset, including connecting to the DANDI API, accessing and exploring NWB files, visualizing data, and suggesting further analysis. This is a standard and helpful introduction to the notebook's purpose.\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell lists the required Python packages for running the code in the notebook. It is important for users to know what dependencies they need to install before running the notebook. The list includes `dandi`, `pynwb`, `h5py`, `remfile`, and `matplotlib`, which are standard packages for DANDI data analysis.\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell imports the necessary Python packages listed in the prior cell. It imports specific modules from `dandi`, `pynwb`, `h5py`, and imports `matplotlib.pyplot` for plotting, and `pandas` for data handling.\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell connects to the DANDI Archive using the DandiAPIClient and retrieves Dandiset 001375. It then extracts and prints basic metadata, including the Dandiset name and URL. This confirms that the connection to the DANDI Archive is successful and that the correct Dandiset has been loaded.\n\nOUTPUT-TEXT: Dandiset name: Septum GABA disruption with DREADDs\nDandiset URL: N/A\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell retrieves a list of assets (files) contained within the Dandiset and prints the number of assets found, as well as the paths of the first five assets. This allows the user to get an overview of the files available within the Dandiset.\n\nOUTPUT-TEXT: Found 7 assets in the dataset\nFirst 5 assets:\n- sub-20200121JJF/sub-20200121JJF_ses-20200121JJF_behavior+ecephys.nwb\n- sub-20200121JJF/sub-20200121JJF_ses-20200121JJF_behavior.nwb\n- sub-20200121JJF/sub-20200121JJF_ses-20200121JJF_ecephys.nwb\n- sub-20200122TSG/sub-20200122TSG_ses-20200122TSG_behavior+ecephys.nwb\n- sub-20200122TSG/sub-20200122TSG_ses-20200122TSG_behavior.nwb\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell specifies the NWB file that will be loaded and provides a link to view it on NeuroSift. The filename is `sub-MS13B/sub-MS13B_ses-20240725T190000_ecephys.nwb` and the NeuroSift URL is provided. Providing the URL is helpful for users who want to explore the file interactively.\n\nISSUES:\nThe specified filename `sub-MS13B/sub-MS13B_ses-20240725T190000_ecephys.nwb` does not exist in the list of assets in the previous cell. The asset paths available are for subjects with IDs like '20200121JJF' and '20200122TSG'. This filename is incorrect and will likely lead to a broken notebook.\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell loads the NWB file from the URL provided in the previous cell using `remfile` and `h5py`. It then uses `pynwb` to read the file and extracts basic session information such as the session description, start time, and file creation date, printing them to the console.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThere are no images in the output.\n\nISSUES:\nThe code runs successfully, however, the URL used does not correspond to the filename provided in the previous markdown cell. The previous cell indicated the file being loaded would be `sub-MS13B/sub-MS13B_ses-20240725T190000_ecephys.nwb`, while this code cell uses the URL `https://api.dandiarchive.org/api/assets/ce525828-8534-4b56-9e47-d2a34d1aa897/download/`. This inconsistency suggests either the filename in the previous cell is incorrect or the URL in this cell is incorrect. The session description \"mouse running laps in virtual hallway\" implies that the correct data has been loaded from the URL, confirming the file name specified in the previous cell is incorrect. There are also warnings about cached namespaces from `hdmf`, which may indicate that some dependency confusion exists in the environment. These warnings, while concerning, do not cause the notebook to fail in this particular implementation.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell attempts to visualize time series data from the loaded NWB file. It creates a plot of a subset (the first 1000 data points) of the time series data. The plot includes a title, axis labels, and a legend.\n\nISSUES:\nThe code will raise an error because the variable `time_series` is not defined before being used in `plt.plot(time_series.data[:1000, 0]`. The NWB file loaded in the previous cell contains various kinds of data, and the user needs to explicitly specify which time series data to visualize and how to access it from the `nwb` object. Without knowing the structure of the loaded NWB file, it is impossible to determine the correct way to access a `time_series` object. This is a critical error that prevents the visualization from being generated.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell provides a brief summary of the notebook's contents and suggests directions for future analysis. It acknowledges that the notebook has introduced the Dandiset and demonstrated how to access and visualize its data and suggests further analysis could focus on specific experiments and advanced data processing techniques.\n\nISSUES:\nBecause the previous plotting cell contained an error, this summary is inaccurate. The notebook failed to visualize data from the Dandiset."
