    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell provides an introduction to the notebook, outlining its purpose, which is to explore Dandiset 001375, specifically focusing on the effects of disrupting GABAergic activity in the septum using DREADDs. It mentions an AI-generated caution, emphasizing the need for careful interpretation of results. The cell includes the title, description, and citation of the Dandiset, along with links to the Dandiset on the DANDI Archive. It also provides a list of the topics that will be covered in the notebook, including loading the Dandiset, extracting metadata, and visualizing data.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell lists the Python packages required to run the notebook. It serves as a quick reference for users to ensure they have the necessary dependencies installed before proceeding.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the next section of the notebook, which will focus on loading the Dandiset. It serves as a heading to delineate the subsequent code and explanation.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell connects to the DANDI archive, retrieves Dandiset \"001375\", and prints basic information about it, including its name and URL. It also lists the assets (NWB files) contained within the Dandiset, displaying the first five asset paths.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell acts as a heading, indicating that the following code will focus on loading an NWB file from the Dandiset.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell specifies the NWB file that will be loaded from the Dandiset, providing its path (\"sub-MS13B/sub-MS13B_ses-20240725T190000_ecephys.nwb\") and asset ID (`ce525828-8534-4b56-9e47-d2a34d1aa897`). It also provides the direct download URL for the NWB file, which will presumably be used in the next code cell.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell loads the NWB file from the specified URL using `remfile`, `h5py`, and `pynwb`. Then, it prints session metadata from the loaded NWB file, including the session description, identifier, session start time, timestamps reference time, and file creation date. A warning is printed about ignoring the cached namespace 'core', which is likely harmless but should be noted.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell serves as a heading, indicating that the following code will focus on visualizing data from the loaded NWB file.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell visualizes a subset of the time series data from the loaded NWB file. It accesses the `time_series` data from the `acquisition` module, selects the first 1000 data points from the first channel, calculates the corresponding time axis, and plots the data. The plot displays the amplitude of the signal over time, with appropriate labels and a grid.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe image is a line plot of \"Sampled Time Series Data\". The x-axis is labeled \"Time (s)\" and ranges from approximately 0.0 to 0.035. The y-axis is labeled \"Amplitude (mV)\" and ranges from -750 to 1000. The plot shows the signal fluctuating over time, starting with a sharp increase, then oscillating between positive and negative values with varying amplitudes. A grid is overlaid for easier reading of values.\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the concluding section of the notebook.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell summarizes the notebook's content, stating that it provides an introductory exploration of Dandiset 001375, focusing on metadata extraction and a brief visualization example. It suggests potential avenues for future analysis, such as more advanced data processing and exploration of different NWB file elements.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone"
