    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the notebook's purpose: to explore Dandiset 001375, a study on the effects of disrupting septal GABAergic activity on brain activity, accessible via extracellular electrophysiology recordings. It states that the notebook will demonstrate loading metadata, listing assets, loading NWB data, and visualizing electrophysiology. It highlights the AI-generated nature of the notebook and suggests readers should exercise caution, before listing the required packages.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell uses the DANDI API to load Dandiset 001375, print its name and URL from the metadata, and list the first 5 assets (files) within the dandiset. The code retrieves and displays basic information about the dandiset and its contents.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nThe number of assets found is inconsistent with the statement that lists the \"first 5\". The output shows there are only 3 assets in total, so \"First 5 assets\" is misleading. It would be clearer and more accurate to simply print all assets without specifying a slice, or to correct the number to \"First 3 assets\". There are also datetime strings in the file names (e.g., `20240725T190000`) which might indicate synthetic data. This is somewhat mitigated by the \"AI-generated\" warning in the first cell, but it would be good to expand on that warning here if possible.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell describes the next step: loading data from a specific NWB file (`sub-MS13B/sub-MS13B_ses-20240725T190000_ecephys.nwb`) within the Dandiset and visualizing extracellular electrophysiology data. It provides the direct download URL for the asset.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell loads the specified NWB file from the given URL using `remfile`, `h5py`, and `pynwb`. It also imports standard packages for plotting. It reads the contents of the NWB file into a `nwb` object. The first line imports the required packages. The next few lines define the URL, open the remote file using `remfile` and `h5py`, create an `NWBHDF5IO` object, and read the NWB file into the `nwb` object.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nThe UserWarning about cached namespaces suggests a potential version conflict between different parts of the hdmf ecosystem. While it might not immediately break the code, it's good practice to check the versions of `hdmf` and `pynwb` to ensure compatibility. It's unlikely that the user can do anything, so this is a very minor issue.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell outlines the next step: visualizing the extracellular electrophysiology data loaded in the previous cell. It specifies that the visualization will include the first 10 channels for the first 1 second of data.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell extracts extracellular electrophysiology data from the loaded NWB file and generates a plot visualizing the first 10 channels for the first second of data. It retrieves the data and sampling rate, calculates the number of time points for 1 second, and creates a figure with subplots for each channel. The time series data for each channel is then plotted on its respective subplot, with appropriate labels and titles.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe image displays a figure composed of 10 subplots arranged vertically. Each subplot shows a time series plot of electrophysiological data for one channel (numbered 0 to 9). The x-axis represents time in seconds, ranging from 0 to 1. The y-axis represents amplitude in microvolts. Each subplot displays fluctuating signals, characteristic of neural activity. The subplots share a common x-axis label \"Time (s)\" on the bottom subplot. The y-axis label indicates the channel number and the unit \"(uV)\". The title of the entire figure is \"Extracellular Electrophysiology Data (First 10 Channels)\". The background of the plot utilizes a seaborn theme with a grid.\n\nISSUES:\nThe code assumes that the \"time_series\" in the acquisition container corresponds to extracellular electrophysiology data. This assumption could be verified by printing `nwb.acquisition[\"time_series\"].description` to confirm. It would be more robust to explicitly target the `ElectricalSeries` object within the NWB file using an XPath. Also, the y-axis labels could be more informative by indicating the physical recording location for each channel, if such information is available in the NWB file.\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell summarizes the notebook's contents and suggests possible future directions for analysis. It highlights that the notebook has demonstrated loading and exploring data from Dandiset 001375 using the DANDI API and PyNWB.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n"
