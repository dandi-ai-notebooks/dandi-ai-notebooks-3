Cell 15
==========

OVERVIEW: This cell introduces the section on exploring behavior data, specifically eye position, and indicates that loading and visualization will be performed.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None

ISSUES: None

Cell 16
==========

OVERVIEW: This cell extracts the `eye_position` data and corresponding timestamps from the NWB file. It accesses the data through the `processing` module, specifically the "behavior" processing module, within that the "eye_position" data interface. The `.data` and `.timestamps` attributes are stored in `eye_position_data` and `eye_position_timestamps`, respectively.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None

ISSUES: None

Cell 17
==========

OVERVIEW: This cell plots the first 10 seconds of eye position data (X and Y coordinates) against time. The `duration` and `sample_rate` variables are used to calculate the number of samples to plot. This provides a visualization of the eye movements during the initial period of the experiment.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The plot shows two lines representing the X and Y components of the eye position data over time. The x-axis is labeled "Time (s)" and the y-axis is labeled "Eye Position (meters)." The blue line represents the "Eye Position X" and the orange line represents the "Eye Position Y." Both lines exhibit a generally decreasing trend from left to right, followed by an increasing trend and some sharp fluctuations at the end. The title of the plot is "Eye Position Data." The x-axis values appear to start around 7.043e5 + 10.

ISSUES:
1. The `sample_rate` is defined as 100 samples per second, but this is not actually used to calculate the subset of timestamps, so the timestamps are not aligned with the data.
2. The values on the x-axis are very large. The offsets from the `session_start_time` should be added to the timestamps before plotting.
3. The y-axis is labeled "Eye Position (meters)," but it's unlikely the eye position would be on the order of meters. This is likely some arbitrary unit. The units, if known, should be included in the NWB file and displayed in the plot.

Cell 18
==========

OVERVIEW: This cell provides a brief description of the plot generated in the previous cell.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None

ISSUES: None. This description is accurate, but could mention the issues noted in the previous cell, e.g. that the y-axis units are arbitrary.

Cell 19
==========

OVERVIEW: This cell introduces the section on exploring behavior data, specifically hand position, and indicates that loading and visualization will be performed.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None

ISSUES: None

Cell 20
==========

OVERVIEW: This cell extracts the `hand_position` data and corresponding timestamps from the NWB file, similar to how the eye position data was extracted earlier. It accesses the data through the same `processing` module ("behavior"), but this time retrieves the "hand_position" data interface.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None

ISSUES: None

Cell 21
==========

OVERVIEW: This cell plots the first 10 seconds of hand position data against time. The `duration` and `sample_rate` variables are used to calculate the number of samples to plot. This visualization shows the hand movement during the initial portion of the experiment.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The plot displays a single blue line representing "Hand Position" over time. The x-axis is labeled "Time (s)" and the y-axis is labeled "Hand Position (voltage)." The hand position is relatively constant at approximately 2.4 until near the end of the x-axis range where it sharply increases to a value of approximately 3.2. The x-axis values look similar to the previous plot, again starting around 7.043e5 + 10. The title of the plot is "Hand Position Data."

ISSUES:
1.  As with the previous plot, the timestamps are not properly aligned as the `sample_rate` is not used to refine them after they are read.
2.  The values on the x-axis are very large. The offsets from the `session_start_time` should be added to the timestamps before plotting.
3.  The y-axis is labeled "Hand Position (voltage)." While voltage could be a unit, it is more likely that the data represents the physical hand position and is represented as a voltage reading from some device. The units, if known, should be included in the NWB file and displayed in the plot.

Cell 22
==========

OVERVIEW: This cell provides a brief description of the plot generated in the previous cell.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None

ISSUES: As with the previous description, it is accurate, but could point out the issues with the plot, such as the odd x-axis and the `voltage` unit.

Cell 23
==========

OVERVIEW: This cell introduces the section on exploring the trial data stored in the `trials` table of the NWB file.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None

ISSUES: None

Cell 24
==========

OVERVIEW: This cell converts the `trials` table in the NWB file to a Pandas DataFrame and displays the first five rows using the `.head()` method. This allows for easy inspection of the trial data, showing information like start and stop times, target locations, reaction times, and other trial-related variables.
