    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell is an introductory markdown cell that provides an overview of the notebook's purpose and content. It introduces the specific Dandiset (001275) being explored, briefly describes the nature of the data (neurophysiology data from primates during a mental navigation task), and outlines the steps that the notebook will follow: loading the Dandiset and its assets, visualizing eye position data and spike counts, and loading trial data. It also lists the necessary Python packages. A disclaimer about the AI-generated nature of the notebook is included, advising caution which is appropriate. This cell sets the stage for the subsequent data exploration and analysis.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell uses the `dandi` library to connect to the DANDI archive and retrieve the specified Dandiset (001275). It then fetches a list of assets (NWB files) associated with the Dandiset. The code then prints the total number of assets found and the paths of the first five assets in the list. This cell successfully establishes a connection to the DANDI archive and retrieves basic information about the Dandiset's contents.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis markdown cell describes the next step in the notebook: loading an NWB file and displaying its metadata. It specifies the target file (`sub-amadeus/sub-amadeus_ses-01042020_behavior+ecephys.nwb`) and provides the direct URL of the asset. This prepares the reader for the subsequent code cell, which will presumably use this URL to load the NWB file.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell loads the NWB file specified in the previous cell using `pynwb`, `h5py`, and `remfile`. It downloads the file from the provided URL, opens it as an HDF5 file, and reads its contents into an `nwb` object. Finally, it prints the representation of the `nwb` object, displaying the NWB file's metadata, including information about devices, electrode groups, electrodes, experimenters, trials, session details, and subject information. This cell successfully retrieves and loads the remote NWB file and displays relevant metadata.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis markdown cell introduces the next section, which focuses on loading and visualizing eye position data from the loaded NWB file.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell extracts the eye position data (x and y coordinates) and corresponding timestamps from the loaded NWB file. It then selects the first 10000 data points for plotting, presumably to manage computational resources. It shifts the timestamps to start from zero. Finally, it generates a plot displaying the eye position x and y coordinates as a function of time. The plot includes labels, a title, a legend, and a grid for better readability.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe image is a line plot showing eye position over time. The x-axis represents time in seconds, ranging from 0 to approximately 85 seconds. The y-axis represents eye position in meters, ranging from approximately -25 meters to +40 meters. There are two lines plotted: a blue line representing \"Eye Position X\" and an orange line representing \"Eye Position Y\". Both lines exhibit some initial decline from t=0 to about t=60s. At around 70 seconds, there are large fluctuations in both x and y eye positions, with sharp peaks and drops. The plot has a title \"Eye Position over Time\", the axes are labeled, and a grid is present for easier reading of values.\n\nISSUES:\nThe units of the y-axis label, \"Eye Position (meters)\", is probably incorrect, as eye position is generally represented in degrees or arbitrary units, not meters. This could be misleading. It's possible the data was pre-processed to map to a position on a screen, but the label should reflect that transformation.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis is a markdown cell describing the key trends and features observed in the eye position plot generated in the previous cell.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis markdown cell introduces the next section, which focuses on loading and visualizing spike counts for different units recorded in the NWB file.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell extracts the 'n_spikes' column from the 'units' table within the NWB file's ecephys processing module. It then generates a histogram showing the distribution of spike counts across all units. The histogram displays the number of units for each range of spike counts, providing insights into the overall neural activity recorded in the dataset. Seaborn is imported to set the plotting theme.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe image is a histogram showing the \"Distribution of Spike Counts for Each Unit\". The x-axis represents the \"Number of Spikes,\" ranging from 0 to approximately 450,000. The y-axis represents the \"Number of Units,\" ranging from 0 to 20. The histogram shows that the majority of units have a low number of spikes, with a large bar at the beginning, indicating that many units have between 0 and approximately 20,000 spikes. The distribution then tapers off, with few units having very high spike counts.\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis markdown cell provides a brief interpretation of the spike count distribution shown in the histogram.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis markdown cell introduces the next section, which focuses on loading and visualizing trial data, providing context for subsequent code.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell extracts trial data (response time 'rt' and go cue time 'gocuettl') from the NWB file. It generates a scatter plot of response time versus go cue time for each trial. The plot aims to visualize the relationship between these two variables and potentially reveal patterns in the subject's performance.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe image is a scatter plot titled \"Response Time vs. Go Cue Time for Each Trial\". The x-axis represents \"Go Cue Time (s)\", ranging from 0 to approximately 14,000. The y-axis represents \"Response Time (s)\", ranging from 0 to 500. Most data points are clustered near the bottom of the plot, indicating low response times (around 0-25 seconds), and scattered along the x axis. There are also a few outliers with higher response times (around 400-500 seconds).\n\nISSUES:\nThe x-axis label \"Go Cue Time (s)\" is likely inaccurate. It is more likely that \"gocuettl\" refers to a property relating to the *delay* between the go cue and target landmark, as named in the original notebook description. The y axis also has some extreme outliers, which might suggest difficulties with the experimental recording or data processing. A few points have reaction times are approaching 500 seconds. This probably indicates an error or a trial where the animal disengaged. The notebook should discuss these possible issues instead of just plotting the data.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell summarizes the notebook's key accomplishments and suggests potential avenues for further analysis. It reiterates the notebook's purpose (loading and visualizing data from Dandiset 001275) and proposes several research questions that could be addressed using the data. This cell effectively concludes the notebook by providing a roadmap for future exploration.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone"
