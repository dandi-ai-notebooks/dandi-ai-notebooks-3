    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell indicates the intention to examine the distribution of trial types.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell analyzes the distribution of trial types present in the dataset. It counts the occurrences of each trial type using `value_counts()` on the 'trial_type' column of the `trials_df` DataFrame. It prints these counts, then plots the distribution as a bar chart. The x-axis of the bar chart displays the trial types (1.0 and 3.0), and the y-axis shows the count for each trial type. The plot is titled \"Distribution of Trial Types,\" and the x- and y-axes are labeled \"Trial Type\" and \"Count,\" respectively. Trial type 3 (MNAV) is significantly more frequent than trial type 1 (NTS).\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe plot is a bar chart that visualizes the distribution of trial types. The x-axis represents the trial type (1.0 and 3.0), and the y-axis shows the number of trials for each type. The bar representing trial type 3.0 is significantly higher than the bar representing trial type 1.0.

    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell calculates and visualizes the success rate of the subject for each trial type. It groups the trials DataFrame by \"trial_type\" and calculates the mean of the \"succ\" (success) column for each trial type. The resulting success rates are printed. A bar plot is generated, showing the success rate for each trial type. The x-axis labels are updated to display descriptive names for the trial types (\"Type 1: Map Visible\" and \"Type 3: Fully Occluded\"). The y-axis is set to a range of 0 to 1 to represent success rate. The plot's title is \"Success Rate by Trial Type,\" and the axes are appropriately labeled. The plot makes it clear that the success rate is higher when the map is visible compared to when it's fully occluded.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe image is a bar plot titled \"Success Rate by Trial Type\". The x-axis displays the two trial types: \"Type 1: Map Visible\" and \"Type 3: Fully Occluded\". The y-axis shows the success rate, ranging from 0 to 1. The bar for \"Type 1: Map Visible\" is taller than the bar for \"Type 3: Fully Occluded,\" indicating a higher success rate for trials where the map is visible.\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell provides an interpretation of the results from the previous cell, noting that the success rate is significantly higher for Type 1 trials (map visible) compared to Type 3 trials (fully occluded). It explains that this difference is expected, as fully occluded trials require greater mental effort and spatial memory.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the analysis of response times for different trial types.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell analyzes and visualizes the distribution of response times (RT) for different trial types. First, it prints descriptive statistics for the overall response times. Then, it generates a histogram of RTs for each trial type on the same plot, focusing on the range of 0-2 seconds and using transparent colors for better visibility.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe image is a histogram displaying the distribution of response times (RTs) for trial types 1 and 3. The x-axis represents the response time in seconds, ranging from 0 to 2. The y-axis represents the count or frequency of trials for each response time bin. Type 1 trials (map visible) are shown in blue and Type 3 trials (fully occluded) are shown in orange. The plot shows that most of the response times fall within the 0-1 second range, and that Type 3 trials appear to have slightly higher response times although there is a considerable overlap between the two distributions.\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell interprets the response time distribution, noting that most responses occur within 0.5-1.0 seconds and that the distribution differs between trial types, with Type 3 having a different pattern from Type 1, likely with a longer tail.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell sets the purpose of exploring the relationship between response time and trial success.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell calculates and plots response time (RT) distributions conditioned on trial success. It first prints descriptive statistics of RTs for successful and failed trials. It generates a histogram showing the RT distribution for successful trials in blue and failed trials in orange. The x-axis represents the response time in seconds, limited to a range of 0-2 seconds, and the y-axis represents the count of trials in each time bin.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe image is a histogram showing the distribution of response times for successful and failed trials. Response times are displayed on the x-axis (from 0 to 2 seconds), and the count of trials is displayed on the y-axis. Successful trials are represented in blue, and failed trials are represented in orange. The plot indicates that successful trials tend to cluster at faster responses (0-0.75 seconds), while failures are more distributed and are heavier tailed.\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell provides an interpretation of the relationship between response time and success, noting that successful trials tend to have shorter response times compared to unsuccessful trials. This suggests that faster responses are associated with increased confidence or accuracy in the mental navigation task.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the analysis of how accurately the subject reproduces the target vector, which is a key aspect of the mental navigation task.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell analyzes the relationship between the actual vector (`ta`) and the produced vector (`tp`). It starts by printing descriptive statistics for both vectors. Then, it filters the data to exclude outliers based on `tp` values. This is followed by plotting the actual vector against the produced vector for different trial types (1 and 3), and it includes a black dashed line representing a \"perfect match\" (where the produced vector equals the actual vector).\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe image is a scatter plot that compares the \"Actual Vector\" (ta) against the \"Produced Vector\" (tp). The x-axis represents the Actual Vector (in seconds), and the y-axis represents the Produced Vector (in seconds). Data points are color-coded by trial type: Type 1 is shown in blue, and Type 3 is shown in orange. A black dashed line represents a \"perfect match\" where the produced vector equals the actual vector. The data points are clustered vertically and the plot suggests a weak correlation between the actual and produced vectors.\n\nISSUES:\n- The filtering of produced vector `tp` `reasonable_tp_mask = trials_df['tp'].abs() < 10` is somewhat arbitrary and should be justified. The value 10 is not motivated by any specific aspect of the data or the task.\n- The plot reveals vertical bands of data points, and this pattern is not explained or examined within the cell. It warrants further investigation.\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell interprets the scatter plot of actual versus produced vectors, stating there is a positive correlation, which suggests the subject makes sensible responses. It also points out the greater variability for Type 3 trials compared to Type 1 trials, implying that mental navigation is less precise when the map is fully occluded.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell sets the stage for analyzing the errors made in vector reproduction by the subject.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell calculates the error and absolute error between the produced and actual vectors. Descriptive statistics are calculated for the error. Absolute error is then analyzed according to trial success, printing descriptive statistics. Finally, the distribution of absolute error is plotted for different trial types.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe image is a histogram that shows the distribution of absolute error for different trial types (1 and 3). The x-axis represents the absolute error (in seconds), and the y-axis represents the count of trials. Type 1 trials are in blue, while Type 3 trials are in orange. The plot shows that Type 3 (fully occluded) trials tend to have higher absolute errors than Type 1 (map visible) trials, with the majority of errors clustered near zero, but with a longer tail indicating more large error values for the Type 3 condition.\n\nISSUES:\n- The code generates a `SettingWithCopyWarning` when creating the `error` and `abs_error` columns in the `filtered_df` DataFrame. While the operations might work as intended, it's best practice to avoid this warning by using `.loc` when adding new columns to a DataFrame. The code should be changed to:\n`filtered_df.loc[:, 'error'] = filtered_df['tp'] - filtered_df['ta']`\n`filtered_df.loc[:, 'abs_error'] = filtered_df['error'].abs()`",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell interprets results from the previous cell. Successful trials show lower absolute errors than unsuccessful trials. Type 1 trials have lower errors compared to Type 3 trials indicating the benefits of visual information on performance.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the analysis of start and target landmark combinations to gain insight into the task structure.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell explores the combinations of start and target landmarks in the experiment. It prints value counts for `curr` and `target` columns, showing the number of trials starting at each landmark and ending at each target. It then generates a cross-tabulation of start and target landmarks using `groupby` and `unstack`, creating a matrix showing the number of trials for each start-target combination. This matrix is then visualized as a heatmap, where the color intensity represents the number of trials for each combination; yellow is low and dark blue is high.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe image is a heatmap that visualizes the number of trials for each combination of start and target landmarks. The x-axis represents the target landmarks (1.0 to 6.0), and the y-axis represents the start landmarks (1.0 to 6.0). The cells are color-coded, with darker blue colors indicating a higher number of trials and lighter colors indicating a lower number of trials. The diagonal elements are all zero. Target landmark 6.0, is reached often when staring at other landmarks like 1.0 and 2.0.\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell interprets the heatmap of landmark transitions. It correctly observes that the diagonal is zero, meaning the start and target landmarks are never the same. The cell also states the the distribution is relatively balanced across landmark combinations, which is somewhat accurate but could also be more nuanced, as certain combinations appear more frequently than others.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",

    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell analyzes the distribution of unit qualities. It counts the occurrences of each quality label (\"good\", \"noise\", \"mua\", \"unsorted\") present in the 'quality' column of the `units_df` DataFrame and prints these counts. It then generates a bar plot displaying this distribution, with the x-axis representing the quality labels and the y-axis representing the count of units for each label.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe image is a bar plot showing the unit quality counts. The x-axis represents the quality labels (\"good\", \"noise\", \"mua\", \"unsorted\"), and the y-axis represents the number of units for each quality. The bars show that there are more \"good\" quality units as compared to \"noise\", \"mua\", and \"unsorted\".\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell provides an interpretation of the unit quality distribution. It notes the number of \"good\", \"MUA\", and \"noise\" units and states that subsequent analysis will focus on \"good\" units.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell sets the stage for analyzing the firing rates of the recorded units.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell analyzes the firing rates of the recorded units. It begins by printing descriptive statistics for the number of spikes per unit. Subsequently, it generates a histogram visualizing the distribution of firing rates across all units.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe image is a histogram showing the distribution of firing rates. The x-axis shows the firing rate in Hz, and the y-axis depicts the count of units. The distribution is heavily skewed towards lower firing rates; many units have low firing rates (<1Hz). The plot is titled \"Distribution of Firing Rates,\" with labeled axes and a grid.\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell interprets the firing rate distribution, noting that most units have low firing rates, which aligns with typical cortical neuron activity. It also correctly points out the presence of a wide range of firing rates, including some units firing at substantially higher rates.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell explores firing rate distributions based on unit quality. It creates a histogram of firing rates for each unit quality category (\"good\", \"noise\", \"mua\", \"unsorted\"). This visualization helps understand if there are differences in firing rate distributions based on unit sorting quality.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe image is a histogram depicting firing rate distributions for units categorized by quality. Firing rate (Hz) is on the x-axis, and the count of units is on the y-axis. Separate histograms are overlaid for each neuronal unit quality category: \"good\" (blue), \"noise\" (orange), \"mua\" (green), and \"unsorted\" (red). There's a concentration of \"noise\" units at very low firing rate. The better quality units are spread out through the firing rates.\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell interprets the relationship between unit quality and firing rate, noting that \"good\" units generally have higher firing rates, whereas \"noise\" units exhibit lower firing rates. This is a reasonable observation, supported by the previous plot.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the analysis of the electrodes used in the recording.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell retrieves and explores the electrode information stored in the NWB file. First, it prints the number of electrodes and lists the column names in the electrode table.

    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell creates a scatter plot that visualizes the relationship between firing rate and electrode depth, separated by by unit quality.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe image is a scatter plot showing the relationship between neuronal firing rate and recording depth, color-coded by unit quality. Depth is plotted on the x-axis and firing rate (Hz) is on the y-axis. The different unit qualities are color-coded: \"good\" (blue), \"noise\" (orange), \"mua\" (green), and \"unsorted\" (red). The plot shows no obvious relationship between recording depth and firing rate, just some units deeper in the brain.\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell attempts to interpret the relationship between firing rate and depth based on the generated scatter plot. It suggests that \"good\" units tend to have higher firing rates, especially at intermediate depths, though it is a weak trend and could be misleading.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nThe interpretation that \"Good units (blue) tend to show higher firing rates, particularly at intermediate depths\" is not well supported by the plot. While it may be true, the scatter plot does not present a convincing case for this observation. The small number of points and their scattered nature make it difficult to draw any firm conclusions. Caution should be exercised in drawing conclusions based on this plot.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the core goal of relating neural activity to behavior by comparing neural activity between successful and unsuccessful trials.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell sets the stage for computing the average firing rates of units during successful and unsuccessful trials.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nSince the actual analysis requires aligning spike times with trial timings which is beyond the scope, this cell simulates a dataframe of firing rates per unit for different trial outcomes. The simulation assumes slightly higher firing rates for successful trials compared to failure trials. Based on the \"good\" units, the simulation generates a firing rate for successful and failed trials with random noise added to the original firing rate. Finally, it plots a scatter of firing rates for success trials vs. failure trials with a identity line (equal rates) plotted for reference.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe image is a scatter plot showing simulated firing rates in successful versus failure trials. The firing rate during successful trials (Hz) is plotted on the x-axis, and the firing rate during failure trials (Hz) is plotted on the y-axis. Each point on the scatter plot represents a single unit. A dashed black line, labeled \"Equal Rates,\" represents the points where the firing rate is identical in both successful and failure trials. points are closely aligned with the line indicating that the rate is very similar on average. Also, the distribution of points indicates a positive correlation between firing rates in success and failure trials.\n\nISSUES:\n- This cell is limited because it is based on simulated data. The notebook explicitly states that it's a simulated analysis due to not having direct access to spike times aligned with trial timings. This acknowledged limitation reduces the cell's impact but it is necessary given the constraints.\n- The simulation assumes a fixed pattern of slightly increased firing rate for successful trials.\n\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell provides a crucial disclaimer that the analysis presented is based on simulated data and would require real spike time alignment for accurate results. Based on simulated data, the plot suggests neurons might have higher firing rates during successful trials versus unsuccessful ones. This might indicate strong neural representation contributes to better performance in the task.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell summarizes the findings from the notebook's exploration of Dandiset 001275, covering both behavioral and neural datasets. It recaps the task, performance metrics, basic neural features, and the simulated behavioral-neural relationship. It also proposes several future directions for researchers interested in further exploring the dataset, such as aligning spike times, calculating PSTHs, identifying neural correlates, performing population dynamics, and investigating learning.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
