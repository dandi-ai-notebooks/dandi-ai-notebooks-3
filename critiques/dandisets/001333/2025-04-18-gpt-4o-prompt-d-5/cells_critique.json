    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the notebook and its purpose: to explore Dandiset 001333, which contains electrophysiological data from Parkinson's patients and control subjects. It highlights the focus on subthalamic nucleus (STN) signals, specifically Beta Average Rectified Voltage (ARV) and Local Field Potential (LFP). It also mentions that the notebook was AI-generated, thus cautioning users about potential inaccuracies. Finally, it outlines the key steps that the notebook will cover: loading the dataset, exploring the NWB file data related to Beta Band Voltage, and visualizing the Beta Band Voltage over time.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell lists the Python packages required for the notebook. It explicitly mentions `pynwb`, `h5py`, `remfile`, `matplotlib`, and `numpy`. It also assumes that users have already installed these packages.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell first imports necessary Python libraries: `DandiAPIClient` from `dandi.dandiapi`, `pynwb`, `h5py`, `remfile`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, and `numpy`. It then connects to the DANDI archive using `DandiAPIClient` and retrieves the Dandiset with ID \"001333\". Finally, it fetches the assets associated with this Dandiset, prints the total number of assets found, and displays the paths of the first 5 assets.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell specifies the NWB file that will be loaded and examined, which is located at `sub-healthy-simulated-beta/sub-healthy-simulated-beta_ses-1044_ecephys.nwb`. It also provides the URL where the file can be downloaded from the DANDI archive: `https://api.dandiarchive.org/api/assets/1d94c7ad-dbaf-43ea-89f2-1b2518fab158/download/`.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell loads the NWB file from the URL specified in the previous cell, using `remfile`, `h5py`, and `pynwb`. It then extracts and prints the session description, session start time, and experiment description from the loaded NWB file. A warning related to namespace versions is also printed to standard output.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell announces the next step: visualizing the Beta Band Voltage over time using the data from the NWB file loaded in the previous steps.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell accesses the 'Beta_Band_Voltage' data from the loaded NWB file. It retrieves the data and corresponding timestamps and then generates a plot of Beta Band Voltage over time. The plot includes labels for the x-axis (Time (s)), y-axis (Voltage (V)), and title (\"Beta Band Voltage Over Time\"), along with a grid for better readability. Finally, the cell closes the NWB I/O and HDF5 file connections to release resources.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe plot displays the Beta Band Voltage over time. The x-axis represents time in seconds, ranging from approximately 10 to 38 seconds. The y-axis represents voltage in volts, ranging from 0 to approximately 0.00014. The plot shows a fluctuating signal, indicating variations in the Beta Band Voltage over this period. The grid lines make it easier to read the values on the plot. The signal appears noisy and oscillatory.\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell summarizes what the notebook covered: exploring the Beta Band Voltage signal from a simulated healthy subject within the Dandiset. It also suggests potential future directions for analysis, such as examining other signal types (ARV) or comparing data between healthy and Parkinsonian subjects.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone"
