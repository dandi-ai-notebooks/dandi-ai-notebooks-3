    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell contains a title for the notebook, indicating the specific Dandiset being explored (001333) and its descriptive name. This cell serves as an introduction and sets the context for the subsequent analysis.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell provides a disclaimer, stating that the notebook was AI-generated and may not be fully verified. This is important for the user to understand the potential limitations and to interpret the results with caution.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell provides a concise overview of the Dandiset 001333. It mentions the type of data (electrophysiological signals), the subjects (healthy and parkinsonian), the focus (beta oscillations in the STN), types of signals (ARV and LFP), and their domain (frequency and time, respectively). It also includes a link to the associated publication and the Dandiset's metadata page, as well as a link to explore the dandiset using the neurosift interface.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell clearly outlines the scope and objectives of the notebook, specifying that it will cover loading the Dandiset, accessing metadata, and loading/visualizing LFP signals. This provides a clear roadmap for the user.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell lists the necessary Python packages for the notebook to function correctly. It prompts the user to ensure these packages are installed in their environment.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell serves as a section header, indicating that the following cells will focus on loading the Dandiset using the DANDI API.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell uses the `dandiapi` library to connect to the DANDI archive, retrieve the Dandiset with ID \"001333\", and list its assets. It then prints the total number of assets and the paths of the first five assets.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the process of loading a specific NWB file from the Dandiset and exploring its metadata. It also mentions the name of the NWB file that will be loaded: `sub-healthy-simulated-beta/sub-healthy-simulated-beta_ses-1044_ecephys.nwb`.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell provides the code for loading and exploring the metadata of a specific NWB file. It first imports necessary libraries (`pynwb`, `h5py`, and `remfile`). Then, it defines the URL of the NWB file and uses `remfile` and `h5py` to load the NWB file remotely. It uses `pynwb` to read the file and extract different aspects of the metadata. The code accesses and displays a large number of metadata fields, including session description, identifier, start time, experimenter, publications, keywords, processing modules, electrode group information, device information, experiment description, lab, institution, electrodes information, subject information. All the outputs of the commands are printed in the output section.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nThe cell produces copious output, which can be overwhelming. While it demonstrates how to access metadata, it doesn't provide much interpretation or guidance on which metadata fields are most relevant or important. The extensive, unorganized output might be difficult for users to parse. A more focused selection of metadata fields and some commentary on their significance would improve the cell's effectiveness.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the next section, which focuses on loading and visualizing electrophysiological data, specifically LFP signals from the \"Beta_Band_Voltage\" ElectricalSeries.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell loads and visualizes the \"Beta_Band_Voltage\" ElectricalSeries data from the specified NWB file. It imports necessary libraries, including `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for plotting. It loads the NWB file, extracts the data and timestamps, and then plots the first 1000 data points as a time series. The plot displays time on the x-axis and beta band voltage on the y-axis.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe image is a line plot of LFP signal (Beta Band Voltage) over time. The x-axis represents time in seconds, ranging from approximately 10 to 30. The y-axis represents the Beta Band Voltage in volts. The plot shows a fluctuating signal, indicative of LFP data, with no obvious trends or patterns within the displayed time window. Seaborn's default theme is used for the plot.\n\nISSUES:\nThe commands `data[:]` and `timestamps[:]` are redundant as they don't actually assign the full data to any variable or do anything with the full data. While not technically wrong, they don't serve a purpose in the visualization. Also, while the plot is correctly generated, there's no further analysis or interpretation of the signal. This is acceptable given the stated scope, but the notebook could be enhanced by pointing out potential features of interest or suggesting next steps for analysis.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell summarizes the notebook's accomplishments and suggests potential avenues for future analysis, such as exploring other files, analyzing frequency content, comparing healthy and parkinsonian subjects data, and developing more advanced visualizations.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone"
