    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the Jupyter notebook's purpose: exploring Dandiset 001333, the Parkinson's Electrophysiological Signal Dataset (PESD). It clarifies that the notebook was AI-generated and may contain unverified content. The cell provides a concise overview of the dataset, including its focus on electrophysiological signals from healthy and parkinsonian subjects and its emphasis on pathological biomarkers. It also outlines the notebook's structure: loading the Dandiset, viewing metadata, and visualizing LFP data. Finally, it lists the necessary Python packages for execution.\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell serves as a section header, indicating that the following cells will focus on loading the Dandiset using the DANDI API. It acts as a roadmap for the user, clarifying the subsequent steps in the notebook.\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell uses the `dandi` package to connect to the DANDI Archive and retrieve Dandiset 001333. It then lists the first five assets (NWB files) within the Dandiset, showing their file paths. The purpose is to demonstrate how to programmatically access the dataset and get a glimpse of its contents.\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell serves as a section header, indicating that the following cells will focus on loading and exploring a NWB (Neurodata Without Borders) file from the Dandiset. This clarifies the next steps in the notebook, transitioning from accessing the Dandiset to analyzing its individual data files.\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell loads a specific NWB file from the Dandiset using its URL. It utilizes `remfile` to handle remote file access, `h5py` to open the file, and `pynwb` to read the NWB data structure. After loading the file, it prints the session description, experimenter, and keywords from the NWB file's metadata. The purpose is to demonstrate how to load an NWB file from the Dandiset and access its descriptive metadata.\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell serves as a section header, signaling that the upcoming cells will focus on visualizing the Local Field Potential (LFP) data extracted from the NWB file. It prepares the reader for the data visualization aspect of the notebook.\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell extracts LFP data and corresponding timestamps from the loaded NWB file. It then generates a plot of the LFP data over time. The plot displays the \"LFP Beta Band Voltage\" for the first 1000 data points. The x-axis represents time in seconds, and the y-axis represents voltage. The plot has a clear title, axis labels, and a legend. The purpose is to show a basic visualization of the electrophysiological data contained within the NWB file.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe plot displays a time series of LFP Beta Band Voltage. The x-axis, labeled \"Time (s)\", ranges from approximately 10 to 30 seconds. The y-axis, labeled \"Voltage (V)\", ranges from 0 to about 0.00012. A blue line shows the fluctuating voltage values over time. The plot title is \"LFP Beta Band Voltage,\" and there's a legend indicating the line represents \"LFP Beta Band Voltage.\"\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell summarizes the notebook's accomplishments and proposes potential avenues for future exploration. It highlights the successful extraction and visualization of LFP data and suggests further investigations into the relationship between these signals and Parkinson's symptoms. It also encourages the use of more advanced visualization techniques and the incorporation of additional data from the dataset.\n\nISSUES:\nNone"
