Cell 1
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell introduces the notebook and indicates the specific Dandiset (001333, the Parkinson's Electrophysiological Signal Dataset) the notebook will focus on. It sets the stage for subsequent cells that will explore and analyze this dataset.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None


Cell 2
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell provides a disclaimer, stating that the notebook was automatically generated and may contain errors. This is crucial for the user to be aware of potential inaccuracies and to critically evaluate the content.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None


Cell 3
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell reiterates the purpose of the notebook and provides a brief description of the Dandiset. It outlines the high-level goals of the notebook, namely to explore and visualize the data within the specified Dandiset.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None


Cell 4
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell provides a direct link to the Dandiset on the Neurosift platform, allowing users to easily access and explore the data independently.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None


Cell 5
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell outlines the structure of the notebook, listing the main steps that will be performed. It also lists the required Python packages needed to run the code in the notebook.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None


Cell 6
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell uses the DANDI API to connect to the DANDI archive, retrieve the specified Dandiset (001333), and list the assets (files) within the Dandiset. It prints the number of assets found and the paths of the first five assets.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 7
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell introduces the next section of the notebook, which focuses on loading a specific NWB file from the Dandiset and displaying its metadata. It specifies the file to be loaded and provides its direct download URL.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 8
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell loads the specified NWB file from the provided URL using `remfile`, `h5py`, and `pynwb`. It then prints the entire NWB file structure, the session description, the identifier, and the session start time. This allows the user to see the basic metadata contained within the NWB file.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 9
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell introduces the next section, which covers the visualization of data from the loaded NWB file. It states the intention to plot the Beta Band Voltage over time, indicating the type of data to be visualized.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 10
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell extracts the "Beta_Band_Voltage" data and corresponding timestamps from the loaded NWB file. It then plots a subset (the first 1000 data points) of the voltage data against time. The plot is labeled with appropriate axis labels and a title.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image is a line plot showing "Beta Band Voltage Over Time". The x-axis is labeled "Time (s)" and ranges from approximately 10 to 30. The y-axis is labeled "Beta Band Voltage (V)" and ranges from 0 to approximately 0.00012. The plot shows a fluctuating voltage signal with several peaks and troughs. The fluctuations appear somewhat random, but there is a clear oscillatory pattern within the beta band.

ISSUES:
None

Cell 11
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell serves as a brief introduction to the following cell, which will contain a dummy plot.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 12
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell generates and displays a simple sine wave plot using `matplotlib` and `numpy`. It creates dummy data for x and y, then plots y as a function of x with appropriate labels and a title.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image is a line plot titled "Dummy Plot". The x-axis is labeled "X" and ranges from 0 to 10. The y-axis is labeled "Y" and ranges from -1 to 1. The plot shows a sine wave, with peaks at approximately x=1.5 and x=7.5, and a trough at approximately x=4.5.

ISSUES:
None

Cell 13
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell summarizes the contents of the notebook and suggests potential avenues for further analysis. It highlights the basic data loading and visualization that was demonstrated, and proposes more in-depth exploration, signal processing, and investigation of relationships between data modalities.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None
