    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell contains a markdown header that introduces the notebook and its focus on Dandiset 001335, which contains Neuropixels recordings from the hippocampus of head-fixed mice during odor presentation. It sets the context for the rest of the notebook.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell contains a markdown disclaimer stating that the notebook was AI-generated and may not be fully verified. It warns users to use caution when interpreting the code and results. This is an important disclaimer, particularly given the intended audience of researchers and data scientists.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell provides a brief overview of the Dandiset being explored. It specifies the type of data (Neuropixels recordings), the brain region (hippocampus), the animal model (head-fixed mice), and the experimental paradigm (odor presentation). It also provides a link to the Dandiset on Neurosift.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell outlines the objectives of the notebook, which are to demonstrate how to load and visualize data from the specified Dandiset. It lists three specific tasks: connecting to the DANDI archive, loading and plotting LFP data, and loading/plotting spike times. This cell provides a clear roadmap for the rest of the notebook.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell lists the Python packages required to execute the code in the notebook. This is helpful for users to ensure they have the necessary dependencies installed.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the section where the Dandiset will be loaded.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell uses the `dandiapi` library to connect to the DANDI archive, retrieve the specified Dandiset (001335), and list its assets. It prints the number of assets found and lists the paths of the first five assets.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nThe output shows that only 1 asset was found, but the code prints the \"First 5 assets:\". While technically correct (it prints 5 lines including the header), it's slightly misleading since there's only one asset. This is a minor stylistic issue.\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the next section, which will focus on loading and visualizing LFP (Local Field Potential) data from the NWB file within the Dandiset. It provides the relative path and URL of the NWB file, making it clear which file will be used for the following analysis.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell loads and visualizes LFP data from the NWB file. It uses `remfile` to access the remote file, `h5py` and `pynwb` to read the data. It selects the first 4 electrodes, a 1-second time window, and plots the LFP data for each electrode, vertically offset for clarity. The plot displays time on the x-axis and LFP amplitude on the y-axis. The electrode IDs are displayed in the legend.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe plot displays the LFP data for four electrodes over a one-second time window. Each electrode's LFP signal is plotted as a line, with different colors representing different electrodes. The signals are vertically offset to prevent them from overlapping, making it easier to distinguish the activity of each electrode. The x-axis represents time in seconds, ranging from 0 to 1. The y-axis represents LFP amplitude in microvolts. The plot includes a title \"LFP Data for Selected Electrodes\" and labels for both axes. A legend identifies each electrode. The plot shows substantial LFP fluctuations, especially after approximately 0.4 seconds.\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell provides a brief description of the LFP plot generated in the previous cell. It summarizes what the plot shows, including the number of electrodes, the time window, the vertical offset, and the approximate range of the LFP data.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the next section, which focuses on loading and visualizing spike times data. It states the intention to load spike times from the units table and generate a histogram.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell loads spike times from the NWB file's units table and generates a histogram of these spike times. It iterates through each unit, extracts the spike times, and concatenates them into a single array. Then, it uses `matplotlib` to plot a histogram, showing the distribution of spike times across the recording duration.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe plot shows a histogram of spike times. The x-axis represents time in seconds, and it extends to around 6200 seconds. The y-axis represents the number of spikes in each time bin. The histogram shows a relatively uniform distribution of spikes across the recording duration, with the number of spikes varying between roughly 40,000 and 70,000 per bin. There are some slight variations in spike counts over time but no apparent large fluctuations.\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell provides a description of the spike time histogram generated in the previous cell. It restates the meaning of the x and y axes and mentions the approximate range of spike times.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell summarizes the notebook's accomplishments, restating that it demonstrated how to load and visualize LFP data and spike times from the Dandiset. It then suggests several possible directions for future analysis, such as examining relationships between LFP and spike times, investigating the effects of odor presentation, and applying advanced signal processing techniques.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone"
