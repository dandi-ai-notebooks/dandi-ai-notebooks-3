    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell focuses on loading metadata from a specific NWB file. It constructs a URL to access the NWB file through the DANDI API, opens it using `remfile` and `h5py`, and reads the NWB file into a `pynwb.NWBFile` object. Finally, it prints the session description, identifier, experimenter, and keywords from the NWB file.\n\nINPUT-CODE:\n```python\nurl = \"https://api.dandiarchive.org/api/assets/aca66db7-4c02-4453-8dcb-a179d44b1c5d/download/\"\nremote_file = remfile.File(url)\nh5_file = h5py.File(remote_file)\nio = pynwb.NWBHDF5IO(file=h5_file)\nnwb = io.read()\n\nprint(f\"Session Description: {nwb.session_description}\")\nprint(f\"Identifier: {nwb.identifier}\")\nprint(f\"Experimenter: {nwb.experimenter}\")\nprint(f\"Keywords: {nwb.keywords[:]}\")\n```\n\nOUTPUT-TEXT:\n```\nSession Description: extracellular electrophysiology during odor sequence presentation\nIdentifier: bd6148c2-4b0f-4691-ba6e-97bd9bb8e407\nExperimenter: ['Manish Mohapatra']\nKeywords: ['hippocampus', 'neuropixels', 'olfaction']\n```\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell extracts LFP data from the NWB file loaded in the previous cell and visualizes it. It accesses the \"LFP\" data interface within the \"ecephys\" processing module, selects the first 1000 samples from the first 10 electrodes, and calculates the corresponding time series based on the sampling rate. The cell then generates a plot of the LFP data, with time on the x-axis and voltage on the y-axis.\n\nINPUT-CODE:\n```python\nlfp_data = nwb.processing[\"ecephys\"].data_interfaces[\"LFP\"].data[0:1000, 0:10] # First 1000 samples of first 10 electrodes\ntime_series = np.arange(0, lfp_data.shape[0], 1) / nwb.processing[\"ecephys\"].data_interfaces[\"LFP\"].rate\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(15, 5))\nplt.plot(time_series, lfp_data)\nplt.title(\"LFP Data Sample\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Time (s)\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Voltage (V)\")\nplt.show()\n```\n\nOUTPUT-IMAGE:\nOUTPUT-IMAGE-1: A line plot showing LFP data over time. The x-axis is labeled \"Time (s)\" and ranges from 0 to approximately 10. The y-axis is labeled \"Voltage (V)\". There are 10 lines plotted, each representing the LFP signal from one of the first 10 electrodes. The signals fluctuate, showing activity patterns over time.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe plot shows the LFP data sample. The x-axis represents time in seconds, ranging from 0 to approximately 10. The y-axis represents voltage. There are 10 different colored lines on the plot, each representing the LFP signal from a different electrode. The signals appear to fluctuate randomly, indicating neural activity.\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell provides a summary of the notebook's accomplishments and suggests directions for future analysis. It reiterates that the notebook successfully loaded, explored, and visualized LFP data from the specified Dandiset. It proposes exploring firing rates, connectivity analysis, and cross-population correlations for future investigations. Finally, it closes the file connection.\n\nINPUT-CODE:\n```python\n# Closing the file\nio.close()\n```\n\nOUTPUT-TEXT:\n```\n```\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n"
