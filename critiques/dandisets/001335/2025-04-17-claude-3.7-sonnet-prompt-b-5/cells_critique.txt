Cell 25
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell performs spectral analysis on the LFP data from a randomly selected channel from the previous cell. The `scipy.signal.spectrogram` function is used to calculate the spectrogram. The cell then plots the spectrogram, showing the power spectral density as a function of time and frequency. The frequency range is limited to 100 Hz, and the y-axis represents the frequency in Hz, while the x-axis represents the time in seconds.

The image is a spectrogram of an LFP channel, with time on the x-axis (ranging from approximately 617 to 625 seconds) and frequency on the y-axis (ranging from 0 to 100 Hz). The color intensity represents the power spectral density in dB/Hz, according to the colorbar on the right. The plot shows a higher concentration of power at lower frequencies (below 20 Hz), with some temporal variations.

ISSUES:
None

Cell 26

OVERVIEW:
This cell calculates and plots the average power spectrum of the LFP signal for the same channel that was used for the spectrogram in the previous cell. `scipy.signal.welch` is used to estimate the power spectrum. The plot displays the power spectral density as a function of frequency, with a logarithmic scale for the y-axis (power).

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image shows the power spectrum of an LFP channel. The x-axis represents frequency in Hz, ranging from 0 to 100. The y-axis represents power/frequency in VÂ²/Hz, with a logarithmic scale. The plot shows a dominant peak at low frequencies (below 10 Hz) and a general decrease in power as frequency increases.

Cell 32
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell defines a function `plot_odor_triggered_raster` that generates a spike raster plot triggered by the onset of a specified odor. The function takes the odor name and a time window as input. It retrieves the presentation times for the specified odor, selects a subset of presentations for clarity, iterates through the selected units and presentations, filters the spikes within the defined time window around each odor onset, and plots a raster for each trial. The plot displays spike times relative to odor onset.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 33
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell calls the `plot_odor_triggered_raster` function to generate a spike raster plot for odor "A." The plot visualizes the spiking activity of the selected units relative to the onset of odor A presentations.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image shows a spike raster plot for odor A presentations. The x-axis represents time relative to odor onset (in seconds), ranging from -1 to 3. The y-axis represents "Trial Ã Unit"; each row corresponds to a trial for one of the units specified, stacked vertically. Each small vertical tick mark represents a spike. The plot also includes a dashed red vertical line at time 0 indicating the odor onset and a dashed blue vertical line at time 2 indicating the approximate odor offset. The spikes are colored differently for each electrode. The plot displays the distribution of spikes relative to the odor onset, suggesting that some units increase their firing rate after the odor is presented.

Cell 35
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell defines a function `plot_odor_firing_rate_comparison` to compare the average firing rates of neurons in response to different odors. The function calculates peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs) for each odor and each unit, calculates the average firing rate and standard error of the mean (SEM) across trials, and plots the average firing rate with error bands showing SEM. The subplot structure facilitates comparison across units and odors.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 36
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell calls the `plot_odor_firing_rate_comparison` function, which generates a plot comparing the average firing rates of the selected units in response to different odors. Each subplot shows the average PSTH for a single neuron in response to each of the six odors, with error bands representing the SEM. The gray shaded area indicates the approximate odor presentation period.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image displays a series of subplots, each showing the firing rate of a single neuron in response to different odors, over a time window from -1 to 3 seconds relative to odor onset. The y-axis of each subplot represents firing rate in Hz, with the scale varying across subplots. Each subplot is labeled with the unit ID. Different colored lines represent the average firing rate for each odor (A-F). Shaded regions around each line represent the standard error of the mean (SEM). A gray shaded area from 0 to 2 seconds indicates the period when the odor was presented. The individual plots within the figure appear to show that neural firing rates vary over the duration of the presented odor, but also that some neurons respond more strongly to certain odors.
