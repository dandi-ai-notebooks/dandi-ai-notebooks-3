    "OVERVIEW: This cell loads the NWB file using the URL obtained from the previous step. It employs `remfile` and `h5py` for remote file access, and `pynwb` to read the NWB file into an `nwb` object. This approach avoids downloading the entire file locally which is efficient.\nIMAGE_DESCRIPTIONS: None\nISSUES: None",

This might be an area to investigate further to improve the completeness of the notebook (e.g., check if that information is really missing or if it is just stored under a different key).\n",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell prepares the reader to examine the raw imaging data, specifically mentioning that the data is stored in a OnePhotonSeries object.\nIMAGE_DESCRIPTIONS: None\nISSUES: None",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell accesses the OnePhotonSeries object named \"OnePhotonSeries\" from the NWB file's acquisition attribute, which contains the raw imaging data. It prints the data's dimensions, data type, frame rate, unit, description, and calculates/prints the total recording duration based on the data shape and frame rate.

    "OVERVIEW: This cell loads four example frames from the OnePhotonSeries object at indices 0, 1000, 2000, and 3000. It then displays these frames as grayscale images using matplotlib. Each frame is labeled with its corresponding time point in seconds. A colorbar is included to represent the fluorescence intensity.\nIMAGE_DESCRIPTIONS: The output displays four grayscale images representing calcium imaging frames at different time points (0.0s, 100.0s, 200.0s, and 300.0s). Each image shows a circular region, with varying levels of brightness indicating fluorescence intensity. There's a visible gradient across each image, likely due to uneven illumination. The colorbar indicates the range of fluorescence values in arbitrary units (a.u.).\nISSUES: The quality of the images is not great, with non-uniform illumination. A better normalization or contrast enhancement might improve the visualization. The warning from `plt.tight_layout()` suggests a potential layout issue that could be addressed.",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell introduces the next step: exploring segmented Regions of Interest (ROIs).\nIMAGE_DESCRIPTIONS: None\nISSUES: None",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell accesses the ROI data stored in the \"ImageSegmentation\" data interface within the \"ophys\" processing module. It specifically retrieves the \"PlaneSegmentation\" object, which contains information about the identified ROIs. Then, it calculates and prints the number of ROIs.\nIMAGE_DESCRIPTIONS: None\nISSUES: None",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell introduces the visualization of the ROI masks, which are spatial representations of the identified neurons.\nIMAGE_DESCRIPTIONS: None\nISSUES: None",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell visualizes the ROI masks. It first prints the shape of the first ROI mask. Then, it creates a 2x3 subplot figure. The first subplot displays a normalized background frame from the raw imaging data. The subsequent subplots (up to five) show individual ROI masks, using a 'hot' colormap to represent the mask values.\n\nIMAGE_DESCRIPTIONS: The figure consists of six subplots. The first subplot, labeled \"Background Frame\", displays a grayscale image similar to the frames in the previous cell. The other five subplots, labeled \"ROI [number] Mask\", show the ROI masks as heatmaps. Each heatmap displays a small bright (yellow/white) region on a dark (black) background, representing the location and shape of an individual ROI. The ROIs vary in position and shape.\n\nISSUES: The code has an off-by-one error in indexing the ROI masks in the loop. The title says e.g. ROI 0 Mask while it's actually showing the values for the first ROI (index 0). Code uses `range(1, min(6, n_rois+1))` but accesses data with `mask = plane_seg.image_mask.data[i-1]`. This could be confusing to the reader. Consider aligning label numbering with array indexing for clarity, or renaming the ROIs from 1 to N internally.\nThe shape of the first ROI mask is (292, 179). The image dims are (320, 200). The code does not seem to register/align these values making it difficult to interpret the location of the mask.\n",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell introduces the analysis of fluorescence traces associated with the ROIs.\nIMAGE_DESCRIPTIONS: None\nISSUES: None",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell accesses the fluorescence data from the NWB file, specifically the \"RoiResponseSeries\" object. It prints the data's dimensions (time points x ROIs), data type, sampling rate, and unit. The shape (9041, 40) indicates there are 9041 time points and 40 ROIs.\nIMAGE_DESCRIPTIONS: None\nISSUES: None",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell introduces the visualization of the fluorescence traces for some example ROIs.\nIMAGE_DESCRIPTIONS: None\nISSUES: None",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell plots the fluorescence traces for the first 5 ROIs over time (limited to the first 5 minutes of recording). It calculates the time axis in minutes and adds a vertical offset to each trace to avoid overlap in the plot.\nIMAGE_DESCRIPTIONS: The plot displays fluorescence traces for 5 ROIs over a 5-minute period. Each ROI's trace is color-coded and vertically offset from the others for visual clarity. The x-axis represents time in minutes, and the y-axis represents fluorescence in arbitrary units, plus the offset value. The traces show fluctuations in fluorescence, indicating neuronal activity. Some traces show clear, sharp peaks, representing calcium transients, while others are relatively flat. A legend identifies each ROI.\nISSUES: None",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell introduces exploring the event amplitude data associated with detected calcium transients.\nIMAGE_DESCRIPTIONS: None\nISSUES: None",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell accesses the event amplitude data, prints its dimensions (which are the same as the fluorescence data, time points x ROIs), data type, sampling rate, and unit. Notice the sampling rate is slightly different from the \"Fluorescence\" and \"OnePhotonSeries\" objects, it is `10.003730030174271 Hz` rather than 10 Hz. This might have implications when comparing the datasets.\nIMAGE_DESCRIPTIONS: None\nISSUES: None",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell sets up a comparison between the fluorescence traces and the detected events.\nIMAGE_DESCRIPTIONS: None\nISSUES: None",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell aims to compare the fluorescence trace and detected event amplitude data for ROI #2 (index 2) over the first 2 minutes of recording. The plot has two subplots: the top one shows the fluorescence trace, and the bottom one should show the detected events. The cell attempts event detection using different thresholds. If no events are found above any of the predefined thresholds, it plots the raw event amplitude data.\nIMAGE_DESCRIPTIONS: The plot consists of two subplots, both sharing the same x-axis (Time in minutes). The top subplot displays the fluorescence trace for ROI 2. The bottom subplot displays the raw event amplitudes as a flat red line due to the lack of event detection above the specified thresholds.\nISSUES: The core issue is that the event detection is not working, and the plot shows only the raw event amplitude data. There seem to be no events detected with the different thresholds and this leads to `raw event amplitudes`. The threshold levels may be too high, or the event data may require some other kind of preprocessing.\nThe title says the time is in the \"first 2 minutes\" but the code comments and variables are a bit confused using both 2 and 5 minutes. The axis limits are correctly set to `2`.\n\nThe sampling rate of `event_amplitude` is slightly different from `roi_response_series`, so it may make sense to resample the event amplitude or fluorescence before performing event detection or comparison.",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell outlines the next step: analyzing correlations between ROIs based on their fluorescence activity.\nIMAGE_DESCRIPTIONS: None\nISSUES: None",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell calculates the correlation matrix of the fluorescence activity between ROIs using a subset of the data (first 5 minutes, downsampled). Then it plots the correlation matrix as a heatmap. It also searches for highly correlated pairs by masking the lower triangle and diagonal and trying different thresholds. The code tries thresholds 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, and 0.4 and prints the number of ROI pairs with correlation exceeding each threshold. If any correlated pairs are found, it prints potentially the top 5 correlated pairs.\nIMAGE_DESCRIPTIONS: The output image shows a heatmap of the correlation matrix between ROIs. The heatmap is mostly uniform in color, indicating very little correlation between any ROI pairs. The colorbar ranges from -1 to 1, but most of the cells on the heatmap are near zero.\nISSUES: The analysis is not yielding any highly correlated pairs. The heatmap illustrates almost no meaningful correlation between any of the ROIs. While the code is correct in calculating the correlation matrix, the fact that there isn't an apparent correlation could be due to several factors:\n1. The downsampling factor of 10 might be too aggressive.\n2. The initial 5 minutes might not be representative of the entire recording.\n3. There genuinely isn't strong linear correlation between these ROIs in this timespan.\n\nIt may worth re-running the analysis with different parameters to see if different insights emerge.\nThe labels of x axis and y axis are too dense, consider using `xticklabels=5` to show only x ticks every 5 ROIs to improve readability.",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell describes the intent to visualize identified highly correlated ROI pairs in terms of both their spatial location and activity patterns. However, based on the previous cell, no highly correlated pairs were found. Therefore, the next cell needs to gracefully handle this and will plot \"something interesting\" or skip the cell.\nIMAGE_DESCRIPTIONS: None\nISSUES: None\n",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell attempts to visualize a highly correlated ROI pair, showing their masks and fluorescence traces. However, since the previous step found no highly correlated pairs, the code gracefully handles this by printing \"No highly correlated ROI pairs found.\" and skipping the rest of the visualization code. This is a good practice of defensive programming.\nIMAGE_DESCRIPTIONS: None\nISSUES: None",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell summarizes what was covered in the notebook, highlighting key findings and suggesting potential future directions for analysis. It is a good conclusion for the notebook.\nIMAGE_DESCRIPTIONS: None\nISSUES: None"
