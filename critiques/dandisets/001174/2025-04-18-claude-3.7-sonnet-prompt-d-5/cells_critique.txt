Cell 1
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell is an introductory markdown cell that sets the context for the notebook. It introduces the Dandiset (001174), describes the experimental context (calcium imaging in macaque SMA and M1), highlights the scientific goals of the original study, provides a link to the dataset on Neurosift, outlines the notebook's objectives, and lists required packages. The warning at the beginning is a good reminder of the notebook's AI-generated nature.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:

ISSUES:
None


Cell 2
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell imports necessary Python libraries for numerical computation (numpy), plotting (matplotlib, seaborn), data manipulation (pandas), date/time handling (datetime), HDF5 file handling (h5py), remote file access (remfile), Neurodata Without Borders (pynwb), and the DANDI API client. It also sets the seaborn theme for plot aesthetics.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None


Cell 3
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell is a markdown cell that introduces the section on loading the Dandiset using the DANDI API. It explains the purpose of this section, which is to connect to the DANDI archive, load the Dandiset, get the metadata, and list available assets.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None


Cell 4
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell uses the DANDI API to connect to the DANDI archive and retrieve information about Dandiset 001174. It fetches the `Dandiset` object, prints the Dandiset ID and version, extracts and prints the Dandiset name and description (with a fallback mechanism in case the API structure changes), retrieves a list of assets associated with the Dandiset, and prints the first five asset paths along with their sizes. The fallback mechanism for metadata is a good practice.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 5
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell is a markdown cell that introduces the next step: exploring a specific NWB file from the Dandiset. It indicates that a file from subject F will be selected for detailed examination.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None


Cell 6
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell aims to select an NWB file for subject F from the list of assets. It first iterates through the assets to find one that contains "sub-F" and "ophys.nwb" in its path. If a suitable asset is found, its path, identifier, and size are printed, and a download URL is constructed. If no such asset is found, a default asset ID and file path are used instead, along with a corresponding message. Finally, the download URL is printed regardless of whether a dynamic asset was found or the default was used. This provides a robust fallback mechanism.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None


Cell 7
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell loads the selected NWB file using the `remfile` and `pynwb` libraries. It opens the remote file using `remfile.File`, accesses it as an HDF5 file using `h5py.File`, and then reads it into a `pynwb.NWBFile` object using `pynwb.NWBHDF5IO`. Finally, it prints basic information about the file, including session description, start time, subject ID, species, sex, and age.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 8
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell is a markdown cell that introduces the next section, which focuses on examining the calcium imaging data within the loaded NWB file. It explains that the data is stored as a OnePhotonSeries (raw data) and processed data in the ophys module, providing context for subsequent code.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 9
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell explores the `OnePhotonSeries` and `ImagingPlane` objects within the loaded NWB file. It prints various attributes of the `OnePhotonSeries`, such as starting time, rate, description, unit, data shape, and data type. It also prints attributes of the `ImagingPlane`, including description, imaging rate, excitation wavelength, location, and indicator. The cell also includes a crucial note about missing "location" and "indicator" information, suggesting that users refer to the original paper for further details. It retrieves and prints device name, description, and manufacturer.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 10
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell is a markdown cell that introduces the next section, which focuses on examining the region-of-interest (ROI) masks, also referred to as cell footprints. It explains the purpose of these masks, which is to represent the spatial location of detected cells in the imaging data.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 11
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell retrieves and examines the ROI masks, also known as cell footprints, from the NWB file. It accesses the `ophys` processing module, gets the `ImageSegmentation` and `PlaneSegmentation` objects, prints the number of ROIs and the available columns in the `PlaneSegmentation` table. The cell includes a very important note regarding small number of ROIs detected in the provided file, and attempts to provide possible explanations. Finally, the shape of the ROI mask for the first ROI is printed.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None


Cell 12
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell generates visualizations of the ROI masks. It first creates a figure with subplots to display individual ROI masks for the first six ROIs (or fewer, if there are less than six ROIs), using a colormap (`viridis`) and adding a colorbar to each subplot. The subplots are titled "ROI i". Then, it creates a combined view of all ROIs, using different colors for each ROI and clipping the combined mask values to the range [0, 1]. The combined mask is displayed as an image with 'All {num_rois} ROIs' title. The individual ROI plots are useful for seeing the specific shapes and intensities of each mask, while the combined plot allows for a quick overview of all ROI locations relative to each other.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The first image output is a 2x3 grid of plots, each displaying a single ROI mask. Each subplot is titled "ROI i," where i is the index of the ROI (0 to 5). The x and y axes are pixel coordinates. The ROI masks are displayed using the `viridis` colormap, with warmer colors (yellow) indicating higher intensity values within the mask. Each subplot also has a colorbar indicating the intensity scale.

The second image output shows a combined view of all six ROIs. Each ROI is assigned a distinct color (red, green, blue, yellow, magenta, cyan) and overlaid on a black background. The x and y axes are pixel coordinates, and the colored regions indicate the locations and shapes of the ROIs. The title of the plot is "All 6 ROIs".

ISSUES:
None

Cell 13
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell is a markdown cell that introduces the next section, which focuses on analyzing the fluorescence traces associated with each ROI. It explains that these traces represent the changing calcium signal over time, which corresponds to neural activity.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 14
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell retrieves and examines the fluorescence data from the NWB file. It accesses the `Fluorescence` data interface and the `RoiResponseSeries` object. It then extracts and prints information about the fluorescence data, including the number of time points, number of ROIs, sampling rate, and the duration of the recording in seconds and minutes.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 15
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell analyzes and visualizes fluorescence traces for each ROI. To manage memory, it analyzes only the first 30 seconds of data. It creates a time vector, loads the corresponding fluorescence data, normalizes each trace to the range [0, 1] (with a check to avoid division by zero if a trace has constant fluorescence), and plots each normalized trace with a vertical offset for better visibility. The plot includes labels, a title, a legend, and a grid, and the x-axis represents time in seconds.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image output is a plot of fluorescence traces for each of the six ROIs over the first 30 seconds of the recording. The x-axis represents time in seconds, and the y-axis represents normalized fluorescence with an added offset. Each ROI's trace is plotted with a different color and labeled in the legend. The fluorescence traces are normalized to the range [0, 1] and then offset vertically so they are easily distinguishable. The plot includes a title "Fluorescence Traces for Each ROI (First 30 seconds)", x-axis label "Time (seconds)", y-axis label "Normalized Fluorescence (offset for visibility)", a legend indicating each ROI, and a grid.

ISSUES:
None

Cell 16
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell is a markdown cell introducing the analysis of event amplitudes. It clarifies that event amplitudes represent detected calcium events, which are linked to neuronal action potentials or bursts of activity.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 17
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell retrieves the event amplitude data from the NWB file and prints information about it, including the number of time points, the number of ROIs, and the sampling rate. It also includes a note about the small difference between the sampling rate of the event amplitude data and the fluorescence data, suggesting that this is likely due to rounding or internal calculation differences.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 18
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell generates a visualization of the event amplitude traces for each ROI over a longer time window of 2 minutes. It calculates a longer time vector, loads the event amplitude data for the extended time window, normalizes each trace to the range [0, 1] (again with a check to avoid division by zero for constant traces), and plots the normalized traces with a vertical offset for better visibility. The plot is labeled with appropriate titles and axis labels, includes a legend, and a grid to enhance readability.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The output image displays the event amplitude traces for each of the 6 ROIs over the first 2 minutes (120 seconds) of the recording. The x-axis represents time in seconds, and the y-axis represents the normalized event amplitude with an added offset. Each ROI's trace is plotted in a different color and labeled in the legend. The event amplitude traces are normalized and offset vertically for better distinguishability. The plot is titled "Event Amplitude Traces for Each ROI (First 2 minutes)", has x-axis labeled "Time (seconds)", y-axis labelled "Normalized Event Amplitude (offset for visibility)", a legend indicating each ROI, and a grid.

ISSUES:
None

Cell 19
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell is a markdown cell that transitions to the topic of analyzing the correlation between ROIs. It states the objective: to compute the correlation matrix of the fluorescence signals to understand how different neurons are correlated with each other.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 20
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell computes and visualizes the correlation matrix between ROI fluorescence traces. First, it determines a correlation window (up to 5 minutes, or the maximum available data length) and extracts the fluorescence data for that window. It then identifies "valid" ROIs that have a standard deviation greater than a small threshold. It prints the number of valid ROIs identified. Basic statistics (mean, standard deviation, min, max, 'Has Variance') for each ROI's fluorescence trace are displayed using a Pandas DataFrame (if available) or a fallback print statement. Then, if there are at least two valid ROIs, it computes the correlation matrix using `np.corrcoef`, handles any resulting NaN values (which can occur if a trace has zero variance) by replacing them with 0.0, and visualizes the correlation matrix using a heatmap generated by `seaborn`. The heatmap has annotations, a `coolwarm` colormap, is scaled from -1 to 1, and has x and y tick labels indicating the ROI numbers. If fewer than two valid ROIs are found, a message indicating that correlation cannot be computed is printed.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
There is no image output. The execution prematurely stopped because there were no ROIs with meaningful variance detected.

ISSUES:
The notebook is unable to compute correlation between fluorescence traces because it cannot detect any ROIs with any meaningful amount of variance. This means that the correlation heatmap is not plotted and the tutorial prematurely terminates. This is likely because of the small subset of data that is loaded from the DANDI archive. It should be noted that there may also be a bug/artifact with the event amplitude data that prevents it from detecting differences in event amplitude over time.

Cell 21
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell provides a summary of the notebook's findings, recapping the steps taken to explore Dandiset 001174, including loading the data via the DANDI API, examining the NWB file structure, visualizing ROI masks, analyzing fluorescence traces and event amplitudes, and attempting to compute ROI correlations. It also suggests potential future directions for analysis, such as comparing activity across sessions and brain areas, conducting temporal and population analyses, and relating neural activity to behavioral measures. Finally, it acknowledges the data contributors.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
The notebook was unable to complete correlation between the ROIs so the fifth learned objective should be removed or reworded in the summary.
