Cell 15
==========

OVERVIEW:
This code cell extracts the first frame from the `OnePhotonSeries` data and displays it as a grayscale image. Before plotting, the shape of the extracted frame and the minimum and maximum intensity values are printed. The plot shows the raw fluorescence intensity of the sample frame using a grayscale colormap. A colorbar indicates the intensity scale. The axes are turned off for cleaner visualization.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image shows a grayscale representation of a raw calcium imaging frame. It's a rectangular image, somewhat brighter towards the bottom right and darker toward the upper left. The intensity values vary representing the fluorescence signal. The colorbar on the right shows the range of intensity values, from approximately 500 to 3000, corresponding to black and white respectively.

Cell 16
==========

OVERVIEW:
This markdown cell introduces exploration of Regions Of Interest (ROIs) which are individual neurons or cell bodies in the calcium imaging data.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 17
==========

OVERVIEW:
This code cell retrieves ROI (Region of Interest) information from the NWB file. It accesses the `ImageSegmentation` data interface within the "ophys" processing module, then accesses the `PlaneSegmentation` object. It determines the number of ROIs and lists the column names in the ROI table. The output shows that there are 21 ROIs and that the ROI table has a column named 'image_mask'.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 18
==========

OVERVIEW:
This markdown cell explains the role of the "image_mask" associated with each ROI and describes the next step which is to visualize a few of the ROI masks.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 19
==========

OVERVIEW:
This code cell extracts and visualizes the image masks for the first 9 ROIs. It iterates through the `'image_mask'` column of the `plane_seg` object to get the masks. Each mask is plotted in a subplot using the 'viridis' colormap. The title of each subplot indicates the ROI number. Unused subplots are hidden.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image is a 3x3 grid of subplots, each displaying the image mask for a different ROI. Each subplot is titled with the ROI number (0 to 8). The masks are shown using the 'viridis' colormap, where darker colors (purples) represent lower values (likely zero) and lighter/yellowish colors represent higher values. The masks appear as small, localized regions of higher intensities against a dark background, indicating the spatial extent of each ROI. Most of the area in each subplot is dark, indicating that each ROI is small. The shapes of the ROIs are mostly blob-like, with varying locations within the frame.

ISSUES:
The printed shapes of the ROI masks, (313, 181), do not match the shape of the raw frame which is (320, 200), suggesting that the 'image_mask' may represent coordinates relative to a zoomed-in or cropped version of the original image. This discrepancy should be clarified in the markdown text for better interpretation of the plots. The 'image_mask' column actually contains a list of coordinates that map to a weighted value, rather than a full image as implied. This is a critical misunderstanding, and a serious error in the notebook's interpretation of the underlying data. Because of this misinterpretation, the plot is misleading and requires correction.


Cell 20
==========

OVERVIEW:
This markdown cell describes the visualization of the ROI masks, stating that bright spots represent neuron cell bodies.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
This description is inaccurate based on the actual contents of the 'image_mask' column, which contains coordinates and weights rather than a binary mask. This inaccuracy follows from the error in the previous cell, and perpetuates the misconception about the data. This is a critical issue.


Cell 21
==========

OVERVIEW:
This markdown cell introduces the analysis of fluorescence signals associated with each ROI. It explains that these signals correlate with neural activity (i.e. action potentials).

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 22
==========

OVERVIEW:
This code cell retrieves fluorescence data from the NWB file. It accesses the `Fluorescence` data interface within the "ophys" processing module, specifically the "RoiResponseSeries". It then prints the shape, data type, and rate of the fluorescence data. It calculates basic statistics (mean, standard deviation, min, max) for each ROI using a sample of the data (first 1000 timepoints) to avoid memory issues. Finally, it prints these statistics for the first five ROIs.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:

Cell 23
==========

OVERVIEW:
This markdown cell introduces the visualization of the mean fluorescence for each ROI.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 24
==========

OVERVIEW:
This code cell generates a bar plot of the mean fluorescence for each ROI. The x-axis represents the ROI index, and the y-axis represents the mean fluorescence. The plot includes a title, axis labels, and a grid.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image is a bar plot showing the mean fluorescence for each ROI. The x-axis is labeled "ROI Index" and spans from 0 to 20. The y-axis is labeled "Mean Fluorescence". The bars are blue, and their heights represent the mean fluorescence value for each ROI. The plot has a grid with dashed lines. Several ROIs (e.g., 5, 11) have very low mean fluorescence, while others (e.g., 4, 14, 16) have significantly higher mean fluorescence.

ISSUES:
The x-axis labels are not completely visible, making it difficult to read the ROI indices. This could be improved by increasing the figure width or rotating the x-axis labels. This is a somewhat minor issue but affects readability/presentation quality. The calculation of `mean_per_roi` was done using only a sample of 1000 timepoints, which may not be representative of the entire dataset. The title is "Mean Fluorescence by ROI", but it would be more accurate to title it "Mean Fluorescence by ROI (First 1000 Timepoints)".


Cell 25
==========

OVERVIEW:
This markdown cell introduces the visualization of fluorescence traces (time series) for a few ROIs.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 26
==========

OVERVIEW:
This code cell plots the fluorescence traces for the first 5 ROIs over a sample period of 1000 timepoints. It creates a time vector in seconds based on the fluorescence sampling rate. It then iterates through the selected ROIs and plots their fluorescence values against time. The plot includes labels for the x-axis (Time in seconds), y-axis (Fluorescence), a title, a legend to identify each ROI, and a grid.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image is a line plot showing the fluorescence traces for 5 ROIs over time. The x-axis represents time in seconds, ranging from 0 to 100. The y-axis represents fluorescence. Each line represents the fluorescence signal of a different ROI, and they are distinguished by color and labeled in the legend. ROI 1 and ROI 2 show almost no variation in fluorescence over the time period plotted, which each trace lying close to the 0 fluorescence point. ROI 0, ROI 3 and ROI 4 show some variation in fluorescence with significant spikes during the time period plotted.

ISSUES:
None

Cell 27
==========

OVERVIEW:
This markdown cell introduces the analysis of event amplitudes, which are said to represent detected calcium events or spikes.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 28
==========

OVERVIEW:
This code cell retrieves event amplitude data from the NWB file and plots the event amplitude traces for the first 5 ROIs over time. It prints the shape and data type of the event amplitude data. It then plots a subset of the data (the first 1000 samples, consistent with previous sections). The plot includes labels for the x-axis (Time in seconds), y-axis (Event Amplitude), a title, a legend to identify each ROI, and a grid.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image is a line plot of event amplitude traces for 5 ROIs across time (0-100 seconds). Most ROIs (1,2,3) show no or very little activity (amplitude near 0) across the entire time range. ROIs 0 and 4 show events only around two time points (at approximately 45 and 60 seconds) when there are simultaneous, large-amplitude deflections. The plotted values are otherwise close to 0.

ISSUES:
"EventAmplitude" sounds like it should have been computed from "Fluorescence", but this relationship is not explicitly demonstrated in the notebook. It is possible the EventAmplitude traces were computed outside of this procedure. The time vector `time` is calculated based `fluorescence.rate`, but it is never explicitly stated that both `fluorescence` and `EventAmplitude` have the same sampling rate. It is however implied, and confirmed by the data. The code works as expected, but being explicit about the sampling rate would improve clarity.

Cell 29
==========

OVERVIEW:
This markdown cell provides an observation about the event amplitude data, noting its discrete nature compared to the continuous fluorescence traces, and linking these discrete events to neural firing.

Cell 30
==========

OVERVIEW:
This markdown cell sets up the following analysis, which is to visualize the activity of all ROIs over time using a heatmap.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 31
==========

OVERVIEW:
This code cell creates a heatmap visualization of the fluorescence activity of all ROIs over time (first 1000 samples). It uses `sns.heatmap` to generate the heatmap, where the rows represent ROIs and the columns represent timepoints. The `sample_data` is transposed so that ROIs are on the y-axis. The colormap is set to 'viridis', and `robust=True` is used to prevent outliers from skewing the color scale. The plot includes labels for the x-axis (Time Sample Index) and y-axis (ROI), and the title indicates what the heatmap represents.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image is a heatmap showing fluorescence activity over time for 21 ROIs. The y-axis represents ROIs, labeled from 0 to 20. The x-axis represents Time Sample Index, spanning from approximately 0 to 992, with an increment of 16 between each visible index. The color intensity represents the fluorescence level, with darker colors (purple/blue) meaning low fluorescence/activity and lighter colors (yellow/green) meaning higher fluorescence/activity, according to the provided viridis colormap. The heatmap clearly shows periods when some ROIs are highly active, and others are not.

ISSUES:
The x-axis labels are difficult to read because they overlap. Rotating the x-axis labels could improve readability. Using a different, more divergent colormap might help to emphasize differences in activity. The heatmap shows "Time Sample Index" on the X-axis, rather than actual "Time (seconds)" as shown in previous plots, so there is a slight consistency issue there. The phrase "Time Sample Index" might also be unclear to those unfamiliar with the data.

Cell 32
==========

OVERVIEW:
This markdown cell introduces the generation of a binary event raster plot to visualize neural activity.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 33
==========

OVERVIEW:
This code cell generates a binary event raster plot from the `sample_event_data`. First, event amplitudes greater than 0 are converted to 1, and all others to 0, creating a binary representation of events. The `plt.imshow` function is used to create a raster plot. The x-axis represents the time in seconds, and the y-axis represents the ROI index. The `extent` parameter is used to set the plot boundaries correctly based on the `time` variable and the number of ROIs. The plot is displayed with appropriate axis labels and a title.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image is a binary raster plot displaying neural events across time for multiple ROIs. The x-axis is labeled "Time (seconds)" ranging up to 100 seconds. The y-axis shows ROIs, numbered 0 to 20. Each row represents a specific ROI, and each vertical line within the row represents an event (amplitude > 0) at that specific time point. Black vertical lines indicate an event, while white space indicates no event. The raster plot reveals which neurons are active at particular times.

ISSUES:
None

OVERVIEW:
This markdown cell introduces the analysis of total activity across all ROIs over time.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 35
==========

OVERVIEW:
This code cell calculates and plots the total population activity over time by summing the fluorescence values across all ROIs at each time point. The sum is performed along `axis=1` of the `sample_data`. The resulting `total_activity` is then plotted against time. The plot has labeled axes, a title, and a grid.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image is a line plot representing the total population activity over time, as measured by summing the fluorescence across all ROIs for each timepoint. The x-axis represents time in seconds and ranges from 0 to 100. The y-axis represents the Sum of Fluorescence Across All ROIs. The plot displays periods of high activity (several peaks above 40) followed by periods of lower activity.

ISSUES:
None

Cell 36
==========

OVERVIEW:
This markdown cell introduces the calculation of the number of simultaneously active neurons for each timestep.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 37
==========

OVERVIEW:
This code cell calculates and plots the number of simultaneously active neurons over time. It sums the binary event data along `axis=1` to count the number of active ROIs at each time point. The result, `active_count`, is then plotted against time, with axes labeled, a title, and a grid.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image is a line plot titled "Number of Simultaneously Active Neurons Over Time". The x-axis represents "Time (seconds)", ranging from 0 to 100. The y-axis represents "Number of Active ROIs". The plot shows frequent brief periods where one neuron is active at the same time, indicated by spikes to the value 1.0 on the y-axis. Two more substantial spikes exist on the plot in which the number of active ROIs is 2 during the same timepoint.

ISSUES:
None

Cell 38
==========

OVERVIEW:
This markdown cell introduces the analysis of correlations between different ROIs, in order to identify coordinated activity patterns.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 39
==========

OVERVIEW:
This code calculates and visualizes the correlation matrix of the fluorescence signals between different ROIs. It initializes a correlation matrix with zeros, and then populates it with Pearson correlation coefficients calculated using `scipy.stats.pearsonr`. Perfect self-correlations (diagonal elements) are set to 1. The correlation matrix is then displayed as a heatmap, with annotations showing the correlation values and a color scheme ('coolwarm') ranging from -1 to 1. The annotation makes the matrix easier to interpret.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image is a heatmap showing the correlation matrix of ROI fluorescence signals. The x and y-axes are labeled with "ROI i" from 0 to 20. The color of each cell represents the Pearson correlation coefficient between the fluorescence signals of the corresponding ROIs, ranging from -1 (blue/cool) to 1 (red/warm). The diagonal elements are red (correlation of 1, self-correlation). Several ROIs appear to have modest positive correlations (e.g. ROI 0 and ROI 8). Several ROI pairs have negative correlations, with several negative values between -0.5 and -0.7.

ISSUES:
The sampling issue remains from previous portions of the analysis, in that the correlations are computed using only a sample of 1000 timesteps. It would be better to compute these with the entire data set. It is also important to clarify in the markdown text that these correlations were computed on the first 1000 timepoints.

Cell 40
==========

OVERVIEW:
This markdown cell introduces the loading of a larger data segment.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 41
==========

OVERVIEW:
This code cell loads a larger segment of the fluorescence data, corresponding to 5 minutes of recording. It calculates the number of samples needed for 5 minutes based on the fluorescence sampling rate. It then extracts the data and creates a corresponding time vector. The output prints confirmation, including the number of samples loaded and the corresponding duration in minutes.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:

==========

OVERVIEW:
This markdown cell introduces the selection of the top 5 most active ROIs for a more detailed analysis of their activity patterns using the larger data segment loaded in the previous cell.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 43
==========

OVERVIEW:
This code cell identifies the top 5 most active ROIs based on the mean fluorescence activity over the 5-minute segment. It calculates the mean fluorescence for each ROI, sorts the ROIs by their mean activity in descending order, and selects the indices of the top 5 ROIs. It then plots the fluorescence traces of these top ROIs over time, normalizing and offsetting each trace for better visualization.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image is an empty plot as there is no data being displayed. All axis are set such that the data of the top 5 most active ROIs are 0.

ISSUES:
The plot is empty, so there is clearly an issue somewhere. The top ROIs from [1 2 3 4 5] appear to not be representative of the top ROIs based off segment\_data. This does not make sense. The previous correlation matrix and figure show different ROIs as being active. It is unclear why it isn't the same ROIs this time around. The top ROI in the heatmap was not one of 1-5.

This plot's x axis range is also an incorrect range. This code is generating an empty plot with the ROIs being incorrectly selected for this long time period. I also believe that ROIs 1,2,3,4,5 will always have very low activity due to the zero values being present in many regions of the time.

Cell 44
==========

OVERVIEW:
This markdown cell provides a summary of the analysis performed in the notebook, along with key findings. It also suggests directions for further research using the dataset.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
The summary contains some important inaccuracies related to the earlier error in interpretation of the ROI masks in the ImageSegmentation, but mostly accurately reflects the proceeding code. It omits mention the fact that the time courses it plots are based only on small time windows. The final claim in the "key findings," about little or no coordinated activity, is not well supported. The correlation image shows a few moderate correlations, and the plot of global firing rate shows that many neurons are firing simultaneously at certain time points. Overall, the discussion is overly optimistic. It does not make mention of the important shortcomings from the sampling, but does mention important future works, which can be continued in similar style to what was present in the notebook.

Cell 45
==========

OVERVIEW:
This markdown cell outlines potential future directions for the analysis of the Dandiset, including comparison of activity patterns, examining activity related to behaviour, analysis of sequential activation, applying advanced analytical methods, and comparing calcium imaging with electrophysiology.
