    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the notebook, specifying the Dandiset it will explore (001174) and giving a brief description of the data contained within: calcium imaging data from the SMA and M1 regions of macaque monkeys. This serves as a clear title and introduction for the notebook.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell provides a crucial disclaimer, acknowledging that the notebook was AI-generated and may contain errors. It advises users to exercise caution when interpreting the code and results. This is important for responsible use of the notebook.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell provides a high-level overview of the Dandiset, including the brain regions (SMA and M1), the animal model (macaques), the data modality (calcium imaging), and a brief description of the experimental paradigm (rest and arm-reaching task). It also provides a link to the Dandiset on Neurosift. This cell successfully contextualizes the following code.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell presents a clear outline of the notebook's content, listing the key steps involved in exploring the Dandiset. This serves as a useful roadmap for the reader.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell lists the Python packages needed to execute the code in the notebook. This is helpful for users to set up their environment correctly.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the section on loading the Dandiset using the DANDI API, providing context for the subsequent code.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell uses the `dandi-api` library to connect to the DANDI archive and retrieve a list of assets (files) within the specified Dandi-set (001174). It then prints the total number of assets and the paths of the first five assets. This confirms that the Dandiset can be accessed programmatically.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the process of loading a specific NWB file from the Dandiset for further examination. It provides the filename (`sub-F/sub-F_ses-20240213T110430_ophys.nwb`) and the corresponding asset ID and URL needed to access the file directly. This prepares the user for the code in the next cell, including providing the code needed to obtain the necessary URL to load the file.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell loads the NWB file specified in the previous cell using `pynwb`, `h5py`, and `remfile` to handle remote access. It then prints the session description, identifier, and start time from the NWB file's metadata. This gives the user a basic understanding of the contents of the file.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the next section, focusing on loading and visualizing the calcium imaging data itself. It indicates the aim is to visualize the mean fluorescence over time.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell loads the \"OnePhotonSeries\" data from the NWB file. It calculates the mean fluorescence for each frame by averaging the pixel values across the width and height of each frame. Note that only the first 1000 frames are used. A time vector is created based on the imaging rate stored in the NWB file. Finally, it generates a plot of the mean fluorescence over time.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe plot shows the mean fluorescence over time. The x-axis represents time in seconds, ranging from 0 to 100. The y-axis represents the mean fluorescence. The plot displays a relatively stable mean fluorescence signal around 2000, with a sudden drop towards approximately 0 around the 35-second mark; the fluorescence returns to its original value just as suddenly.\n\nISSUES:\nThe sudden drop in fluorescence at around 35 seconds is suspicious and warrants further investigation. It could be a data artifact or a real event. The notebook should address this feature in the data. It would also be good to show the full time series of data, rather than restricting the initial analysis to the first 1000 frames.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell provides an interpretation of the plot generated in the previous cell, noting the sharp drop in fluorescence and suggesting potential causes for this observation. This is a good start and acknowledges the issues identified previously.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the examination of image masks, providing context for the subsequent code.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell extracts the image masks from the \"PlaneSegmentation\" within the NWB file's processing module (\"ophys\"). It then plots the maximum projection of these masks along the first axis (presumably the number of ROIs). The result is a grayscale image showing the spatial locations of the identified regions of interest (ROIs).\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe plot displays a grayscale image of the image masks. The image is mostly black, with several bright, blob-like shapes scattered across the field. These shapes represent the ROIs (regions of interest) identified in the imaging data. The gray values within each blob likely represent the weighting or probability that a given pixel belongs to that ROI.\n\nISSUES:\nIt would be helpful to state the number of ROIs. This is especially important since the plot uses `np.max`, but it is difficult to know whether the np.max() is over all of the ROIs. In other words, is this the union of ALL ROIs, or just which ROI has the highest value in that pixel? If it's the latter, we aren't seeing all ROIs. A better plot would be to show a few of the ROIs individually, or perhaps overlayed with different colors and some transparency.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell provides a brief interpretation of the image masks, stating that they represent the outlines of the cells being imaged. This is a basic but useful explanation.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the final section, which focuses on exploring the activity patterns (fluorescence traces) of individual regions of interest (ROIs).\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell extracts the fluorescence traces from the \"RoiResponseSeries\" within the NWB file's \"Fluorescence\" data interface. It selects the first three ROIs (IDs 0, 1, and 2) and plots their fluorescence activity over time. A time vector is created from the acquisition rate.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe plot displays the fluorescence traces for three ROIs (0, 1, and 2) over time. The x-axis represents time in seconds, ranging from 0 to 600. The y-axis shows the fluorescence intensity. Each ROI's activity is represented by a different colored line. The traces show periods of relatively low activity interspersed with sharp, transient increases in fluorescence, indicating neuronal activity.\n\nISSUES:\nThe y-axis label says \"Fluorescence\", but it is unclear if this is raw fluorescence, or dF/F. That should be specified. Also, the choice of plotting the first three ROIs is arbitrary. It would be more interesting to select ROIs based on some criteria, such as those with the highest peak activity or most frequent spiking. This is a good first step, but leaves the user without suggestions on performing more sophisticated analysis.\nThe odd drop in mean fluorescence at around 35 seconds is not discussed in light of single ROI activities here. Does this sudden drop affect all ROIs equally or just a subset?",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell provides a basic interpretation of the fluorescence traces plotted in the previous cell. It observes and describes the differences in activity patterns between the three ROIs, noting differences in the amplitude and frequency of spikes.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell provides a summary of the notebook's content, reiterating the key steps covered: loading the Dandiset, examining metadata, visualizing calcium imaging data, and exploring ROI activity. It also outlines several potential avenues for future analysis, such as spike detection, spike sorting, correlation analysis, and relating neuronal activity to behavior.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone"
