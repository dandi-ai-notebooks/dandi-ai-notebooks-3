    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell is an introductory markdown cell. It provides the title of the notebook, \"Exploring Dandiset 001174: Calcium Imaging in SMA and M1 of Macaques,\" and a disclaimer that the notebook was AI-generated and may contain errors. The purpose is to alert the user to the unverified nature of the content and encourage critical evaluation.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis markdown cell provides an overview of the Dandiset with ID DANDI:001174. It includes the title, ID, a brief description of the dataset (calcium imaging in SMA and M1 of macaques during motor tasks), the license (CC-BY-4.0), keywords describing the data, and a citation. The purpose is to introduce the dataset to the user.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell outlines the contents of the notebook. It states that the notebook will cover loading data using the DANDI API, exploring metadata and available data, and visualizing data from an NWB file. The purpose is to give the user a roadmap of what to expect in the notebook.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell lists the Python packages required to run the notebook. They include `pynwb`, `h5py`, `remfile`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`. The purpose is to inform the user about the necessary dependencies.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis code cell imports the necessary Python packages. It imports `pynwb`, `h5py`, `remfile`, `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`, and `seaborn` as `sns`. It also uses `sns.set_theme()` to set the default plotting theme for seaborn. The purpose is to make these libraries available for use in the subsequent cells.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell is a markdown cell that introduces the next step: loading data from Dandiset 001174 using the DANDI API and reviewing its assets. This cell serves as a heading and a brief description of what the following code will do.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis code cell uses the `dandiapi` library to connect to the DANDI archive, retrieve Dandiset 001174, and list its assets. It prints the total number of assets found and the paths of the first five assets.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis markdown cell introduces the next section, which focuses on loading and exploring metadata from an NWB file within the Dandiset. It explains that the following code will extract metadata and session details to understand the structure of the data.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis code cell loads an NWB file from a specified URL using `remfile` and `h5py`. It then reads the NWB file into a `pynwb.NWBFile` object. Finally, it prints the session description and the number of acquisition data series. The purpose is to load an example NWB file from the Dandiset and display some basic metadata.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis markdown cell introduces the visualization of `OnePhotonSeries` data. It states that the next step involves visualizing a section of the data to explore neuron activity patterns.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis code cell retrieves the `OnePhotonSeries` data from the loaded NWB file. It then selects a single timepoint (index 0) and visualizes the data as an image using `plt.imshow`. The plot shows the fluorescence intensity across the X and Y coordinates. A colorbar is included to represent the intensity scale.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe plot is a heatmap showing fluorescence intensity. The X-axis represents the X coordinate, and the Y-axis represents the Y coordinate. The color scale ranges from dark red to bright yellow, with yellow indicating higher fluorescence intensity. The plot is titled \"OnePhotonSeries Data Visualization,\" and there is a colorbar labeled \"Fluorescence Intensity\" on the right side of the plot. Features within the image appear as regions of different fluorescence intensities.\n\nISSUES:\nThe visualization picks an arbitrary timepoint. It would be much more helpful if it showed either a mean fluorescence across time, or a maximum projection, or allowed selection of different timepoints. Also, the plot only shows the first time point; it does not demonstrate neuron activity *patterns* over time, which is what the markdown cell claimed it would do.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis is a concluding markdown cell. It summarizes what the notebook has covered (loading and exploring data in Dandiset 001174) and suggests future directions for exploration and analysis.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone"
