Cell 1
==========

OVERVIEW: This cell introduces the notebook and the specific Dandiset (001174) that it will be exploring. It sets the context for the analysis that follows, indicating the data modality (calcium imaging) and brain regions involved (SMA and M1 of macaques).
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None
ISSUES: None


Cell 2
==========

OVERVIEW: This cell is a disclaimer, stating that the notebook was AI-generated and the content should be interpreted with caution. This is important because AI-generated content may contain errors or inaccuracies.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None
ISSUES: None


Cell 3
==========

OVERVIEW: This cell provides an overview of the notebook's objectives. It outlines the key steps involved in exploring the Dandiset, including loading metadata, streaming NWB files, visualizing the data using a contrast-stretched max projection, and plotting event amplitude time series for a selected ROI.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None
ISSUES: None

Cell 4
==========

OVERVIEW: This cell provides a direct link to the Dandiset in Neurosift, a web-based tool for visualizing and exploring neurophysiology data. This allows users to quickly preview the dataset.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None
ISSUES: None

Cell 5
==========

OVERVIEW: This cell lists the Python packages required to run the notebook. This is useful for the user to ensure they have the necessary dependencies installed.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None
ISSUES: None

Cell 6
==========

OVERVIEW: This cell introduces the next section of the notebook, which focuses on loading the Dandiset metadata and listing its assets.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None
ISSUES: None

Cell 7
==========

OVERVIEW: This cell uses the `dandi` package to connect to the DANDI Archive, retrieve Dandiset 001174, and list its assets. It prints the total number of assets and displays the paths of the first five assets. This provides a quick overview of the dataset's structure.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None
ISSUES: None

Cell 8
==========

OVERVIEW: This cell provides context for the next code cell, indicating that the notebook will focus on the NWB file from subject Q containing data from spontaneous activity.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None
ISSUES: None

Cell 9
==========

OVERVIEW: This cell loads a specific NWB file from the DANDI Archive using `remfile`, `h5py`, and `pynwb`. It retrieves the file via a URL, opens it as an HDF5 file, and reads its contents into an NWB object. The cell then prints the session description, identifier, and start time from the NWB file to confirm that the correct data has been loaded.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None
ISSUES: None

Cell 10
==========

OVERVIEW: This cell introduces the next section, focusing on generating a contrast-stretched max projection image from the calcium imaging data. It specifies that the projection will be computed over the first 100 frames.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None
ISSUES: None

Cell 11
==========

OVERVIEW: This cell computes and displays a contrast-stretched max projection of the calcium imaging data. It extracts the first 100 frames from the "OnePhotonSeries", calculates the maximum projection along the time axis, and then applies a contrast stretch using the 2nd and 98th percentiles. The resulting image is displayed using matplotlib.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: The generated image is a grayscale image titled "Contrast-Stretched Max Projection". It shows an oval region which is brighter in the center and darker at the periphery. There are a few bright spots scattered across the image, presumably representing cells or other structures. There is a long curved dark marking from the top left to slightly right of center. The image is displayed without axes.

ISSUES: None

Cell 12
==========

OVERVIEW: This cell sets the stage for the final analysis step: extracting and plotting an event amplitude time series for a specific region of interest (ROI 0). It specifies that the first 1000 samples will be plotted.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None
ISSUES: None

Cell 13
==========

OVERVIEW: This cell extracts the event amplitude data for ROI 0 from the NWB file and plots the time series. It retrieves the `EventAmplitude` data, its sampling rate, and starting time. It then calculates the time axis and extracts the amplitude series for the specified ROI. Finally, it generates a plot of the event amplitude over time, with appropriate labels and title.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: The plot is a time series titled "Event Amplitude Time Series (ROI 0)". The x-axis is labeled "Time (s)" and the y-axis is labeled "Event Amplitude (fluorescence)". The plot shows a mostly flat line at zero, with occasional sharp, narrow peaks rising to different fluorescence amplitudes. There are event occurrences close to 0s, 2500s, 4200s, 5800s, 6500s, 9200s, and 9800s.

ISSUES: None

Cell 14
==========

OVERVIEW: This cell summarizes the steps performed in the notebook and suggests potential directions for further analysis. It accurately lists the key tasks completed and proposes more in-depth explorations, such as comparing data across ROIs, analyzing synchrony, and integrating behavioral data.
