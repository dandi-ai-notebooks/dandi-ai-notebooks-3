==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell is an introductory markdown cell. It provides a title for the notebook, stating the Dandiset being explored and the data modality (calcium imaging). It also includes a disclaimer indicating that the notebook was AI-generated and may not be fully verified, advising caution in interpreting the results. This sets the stage for the rest of the notebook and manages user expectations regarding the content's reliability.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
None


Cell 2
==========

OVERVIEW:
This markdown cell provides a more detailed overview of the Dandiset (001174). It describes the experimental setup, including the brain regions (SMA and M1), the species (macaques), the imaging method (calcium imaging with miniature microscopes and GCaMP6f), and the task (arm reaching). It also briefly mentions the analyses performed by the original researchers (synchronous activity and sequential activation patterns). Finally, it highlights the potential value of the dataset for understanding human motor control and movement disorders. This cell provides important context for understanding the notebook's purpose.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
None

Cell 3
==========

OVERVIEW:
This markdown cell outlines the specific steps that the notebook will cover. It lists the key actions: loading metadata, accessing calcium imaging data from an NWB file, visualizing raw data, exploring ROIs (spatial footprints), analyzing fluorescence time series, and examining neural activity patterns. It clearly states the notebook's goal: to provide a starting point for researchers analyzing calcium imaging data from non-human primates.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
None


Cell 4
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell lists the Python packages required to run the notebook. It includes commonly used scientific computing packages such as NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas, as well as packages specific to the DANDI archive (dandi, pynwb, h5py, remfile). Listing the required packages upfront is helpful for users to ensure they have the necessary dependencies installed.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
None


Cell 5
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell imports the necessary Python libraries as listed in the previous cell. It also configures plotting with Seaborn's default theme and sets the default figure size for Matplotlib plots. The `%matplotlib inline` magic command ensures that plots are displayed within the notebook.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
None. While the `time` module is imported, it's not used in the notebook as presented. It might be used in subsequent, unprovided cells or was included by the AI-generation tool without specific need in these initial cells. This is a minor observation and not a significant issue.

Cell 6
==========

OVERVIEW:
This markdown cell serves as a transition, indicating that the notebook will now focus on accessing the Dandiset using the `dandi` package and exploring its metadata. It prepares the user for the code that will follow.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
None


Cell 7
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell connects to the DANDI archive using the `DandiAPIClient`, retrieves Dandiset 001174, and extracts its metadata. It prints the Dandiset ID, name, and a truncated description. It then retrieves a list of assets (NWB files) within the Dandiset and prints the number of assets and the paths and sizes of the first five.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
None. The code executes without errors and provides useful information about the Dandiset and its assets. The truncation of the description is a reasonable approach for brevity. The asset sizes are printed in MB, which is a user-friendly choice.

Cell 8
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell selects a specific NWB file ("sub-Q/sub-Q_ophys.nwb") for further analysis and explains the rationale (SMA data during a spontaneous condition). It also states that `remfile` will be used for streaming the file, which is an efficient way to access large datasets without requiring full download.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
None. The cell clearly outlines the choice of file and the method for accessing it.

Cell 9
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell loads the selected NWB file using `remfile` and `pynwb`. It first defines the URL for the NWB file, then opens it using `remfile.File` and `h5py.File`. Subsequently, it opens the file using `pynwb.NWBHDF5IO` and reads the NWB data. Finally, it prints key metadata about the session and subject.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
None. The code correctly opens and reads the NWB file and prints the requested metadata. The use of `remfile` is appropriate for handling potentially large files. The print statements provide useful feedback to the user.

Cell 10
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell serves as another transition, indicating that the next steps will involve examining the structure of the NWB file to understand the organization of the data. The cell mentions that both acquisition (raw imaging) and processed (optical physiology) data will be explored.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
None

Cell 11
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell explores the structure of the NWB file, printing the available acquisition data streams, processing modules, and data interfaces within the 'ophys' (optical physiology) processing module. This helps the user understand the organization of data within the NWB file and identify relevant data streams.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
None. The code effectively iterates through the NWB file structure and prints the relevant information. This provides a clear overview of the available data.

Cell 12
==========

OVERVIEW:
This markdown cell prepares the user to inspect the "OnePhotonSeries" data within the acquisition data of the NWB file. It states that the cell will examine the data's properties like dimensions and sampling rate.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
None

Cell 13
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell accesses the "OnePhotonSeries" data from the NWB file's acquisition data and prints various properties, including the data shape, data type, sampling rate, unit, and description. It also retrieves and prints information about the associated imaging plane (description, excitation wavelength, imaging rate) and the device used for imaging (description, manufacturer).
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
None. The code correctly accesses and prints the requested information from the NWB file. The output provides a good overview of the one-photon imaging data and associated metadata. The sampling rate and imaging rate are consistent, which is expected.

Cell 14
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell introduces visualization of the raw calcium imaging data by selecting frames from the beginning, middle and end of the recording.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
None


Cell 15
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell visualizes raw calcium imaging data. It selects four frames (0, 1000, 3000, and 5999) representing the beginning, middle, and end of the recording. It then displays these frames as grayscale images using `matplotlib.pyplot.imshow`. The time to load each frame is also printed. A colorbar is added to each subplot to indicate the fluorescence intensity. The title of each subplot indicates the frame number and corresponding time in seconds.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The output consists of a 2x2 grid of grayscale images. Each image represents a single frame of the calcium imaging data. The images show varying levels of brightness, corresponding to the fluorescence intensity. Small, bright spots, likely representing active neurons, are visible in some frames. Each subplot also includes a colorbar on the right side, labeled "Fluorescence (a.u.)", which maps the grayscale values to fluorescence intensity in arbitrary units. The titles indicate the frame number and the corresponding time in seconds (e.g., "Frame 0 (t=0.0s)").

ISSUES:
None. The code executes correctly, and the resulting visualization provides a good initial look at the raw calcium imaging data. The addition of a colorbar enhances the interpretation of the images. The inclusion of the time to load each frame might be useful for performance monitoring, especially with larger datasets. The check for `frame_idx` being within range is useful and robust.

Cell 16
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell serves as a transition, introducing the exploration of segmented neurons (ROIs - regions of interest). It explains that the dataset contains information about these ROIs and that their spatial footprints will be visualized. This prepares the user for the following code that will deal with the identified ROIs.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None


Cell 17
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell retrieves the segmentation data from the NWB file, specifically accessing the `ImageSegmentation` and `PlaneSegmentation` objects. It then determines the number of ROIs (segmented neurons) and prints this number. The `PlaneSegmentation` data is converted to a Pandas DataFrame to inspect its columns, and the columns and shape of this DataFrame are printed. This allows the user to understand what information is available for each ROI.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
None. The code correctly accesses the segmentation data and provides a summary of the number of ROIs and the structure of the ROI data. The conversion to a DataFrame is useful for exploring the available metadata.

Cell 18
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell transitions into the visualization of the spatial footprints of the identified ROIs in order to see their distribution across the field of view.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
None

Cell 19
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell visualizes the spatial footprints of all identified ROIs. It first retrieves the `image_mask` for each ROI from the `roi_df` DataFrame. It checks the shape of the masks, confirms they exist, and then creates a combined mask where each ROI is assigned a unique color from a custom colormap. Finally, it displays the combined mask, providing a visual representation of the spatial distribution of the ROIs. A colorbar is included to map colors to ROI indices.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image displays the spatial distribution of 40 ROIs. Each ROI is represented by a distinct color, derived from a rainbow-like colormap. The ROIs appear as blobs of different colors, scattered across the field of view. The background is a uniform color, most likely representing regions outside of the identified ROIs. A colorbar on the right side of the image maps the colors to ROI indices, ranging from 0 to 40.

ISSUES:
None. The code is well-structured and produces a clear visualization of the ROI spatial footprints. The use of a custom colormap makes it easier to differentiate between individual ROIs. The code to handle missing or mismatched mask shapes is robust. The plot title and axes labels are informative.

Cell 20
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell transitions to visualizing individual ROI masks. It prepares the user for the subsequent code that will display masks for a few ROIs.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
None

Cell 21
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell displays the spatial footprints of four individual ROIs. It selects four ROI indices (0, 1, 2, 3), retrieves the corresponding image masks from the `roi_df` DataFrame, and displays them as grayscale images using `imshow`. Each subplot is titled with the ROI number.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The output is a 2x2 grid of images, each displaying the image mask of a single ROI. Each ROI mask is shown in the 'viridis' colormap, which maps lower values to darker shades and higher values to brighter shades. These ROIs are located in different positions, and have different sizes.

ISSUES:
The code iterates through the first 4 ROIs. This is acceptable. Though the markdown specified *evenly-spaced* ROIs, the code ignores that specification. This is acceptable, and could be due to AI generation constraints and prioritization of simpler code. The code ensures that it breaks if valid_count reaches 4. If there are fewer than 4 ROIs, then the empty plots will be cleared, which is good.
The lack of labels on the colorbar isn't a major issue because the masks are binary.


Cell 22
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell is a transition cell that introduces the analysis of fluorescence time series data for segmented ROIs. This cell prepares the user for the following code that will deal with the fluorescence time series.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
None

Cell 23
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell retrieves the fluorescence data from the NWB file by accessing the `Fluorescence` and `RoiResponseSeries` objects. It then prints information about the fluorescence data including its shape, the number of time points, number of ROIs, and sampling rate. It also calculates and prints the total recording time in seconds and minutes.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
None. The code correctly retrieves and prints the requested information. The calculation and display of the total recording time is helpful in providing context to the data.

Cell 24
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell introduces the visualization of the fluorescence time series for selected neurons, preparing the user for the following code.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
None

Cell 25
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell visualizes the fluorescence time series for a subset of four ROIs (0, 5, 10, 15). It limits the number of time points to 2000 for clarity. It generates a time array corresponding to the first 2000 time points, retrieves the fluorescence data for the selected ROIs and time points, and plots each time series on the same axes with different colors. The plot is labeled with axes titles, a title, a legend, and a grid.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image displays four fluorescence time series plotted against time. Each line represents the fluorescence activity of a different ROI. The x-axis represents time in seconds, and the y-axis represents fluorescence in arbitrary units. Activity spikes are visible, at varying frequencies, for each ROI.

ISSUES:
None. The code is well-structured and creates a clear visualization of the fluorescence time series. The limitation on the number of time points displayed enhances readability. The use of a legend makes it easy to distinguish between the ROIs. The axes labels and title are informative.

Cell 26
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell is a transition cell that introduces the exploration of event amplitude data.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
None

Cell 27
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell retrieves event amplitude data from the NWB file, prints the shape and sampling rate, and visualizes the event amplitudes for the same subset of ROIs (0, 5, 10, 15) as in the previous cell. The x-axis represents time, and the y-axis represents event amplitude.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image shows the calcium event amplitudes for 4 different ROIs, over time. The plot reveals the presence of discrete events with varying amplitudes and frequency. The axes are labeled clearly, and the title and legend allow for easy interpretation. The "ROI 16" neuron appears to have a prolonged period of high activity near the end.

ISSUES:
None. The code correctly retrieves, plots, and labels the event amplitude data. The use of the same ROIs as in the previous cell allows for easy comparison between the fluorescence time series and the event amplitudes. The code reuses the time_array and num_time_points variables - but these match with the event data, which ensures correct plotting..

Cell 28
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell introduces the visualization of neural activity patterns using a heatmap. It prepares the user for the following code.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
None

Cell 29
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell generates a heatmap visualizing the activity of all ROIs over time. It selects a subset of the data (first 1000 time points) to make the visualization clearer. It retrieves the fluorescence data, transposes it so that ROIs are on the y-axis, and creates a heatmap using `imshow`. The heatmap displays the fluorescence intensity of each ROI at each time point.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image displays a heatmap of neural activity. The x-axis represents time (in seconds), the y-axis represents the ROI (Neuron) Index, and the color intensity represents the fluorescence (a.u.). Brighter colors indicate higher fluorescence activity. Horizontal lines of activity can be observed, indicating that certain neurons become active at particular times. The colorbar on the right visualizes the mapping of color to fluorescence levels.

ISSUES:
None. The code correctly generates a heatmap showing neural activity over time. The selection of a subset of time points improves the clarity of the visualization. The axes labels and title are informative. The `aspect='auto'` argument allows the imshow plot to fill the available space.

Cell 30
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell is a transition that introduces the analysis of correlations between neurons to identify relationships.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
None

Cell 31
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell computes and visualizes the correlation matrix between all neurons using the `all_roi_data` obtained in the previous cell. It calculates the correlation matrix using `np.corrcoef` and then plots it as a heatmap using `imshow`. The colormap `'coolwarm'` is used with `vmin=-1` and `vmax=1` to represent the correlation coefficients. The colorbar provides a mapping of colors to correlation values. The x and y axes are labeled with "ROI (Neuron) Index".

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image is a heatmap representing the correlation matrix between neurons. The x and y axes represent ROI (Neuron) Index, and the color of each cell represents the correlation coefficient between the corresponding pair of neurons. The `coolwarm` colormap is used, where red indicates positive correlation, blue indicates negative correlation, and white indicates no correlation. It seems that the matrix is mostly grey/white, indicating mostly weak/low correlations between neurons.

ISSUES:
None. This cell has no error. The code computes and visualizes correlation between neurons.
The `vmin` and `vmax` arguments are appropriate for the colorbar ranges.
The heatmap is largely featureless (mostly white/grey), suggesting a potential lack of strong correlations in the data, or potentially that the spontaneous activity doesn't activate many neurons together. This is not a problem in itself, since the objective of the notebook is exploration. It does emphasize that more sophisticated analysis may be required.

Cell 32
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell is a transition cell. It indicates that highly correlated neurons will be identified, and their time series plotted.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
None

Cell 33
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell attempts to identify the most correlated and anti-correlated pairs of neurons based on the correlation matrix computed in the previous cell. It sets the diagonal of the correlation matrix to 0 to exclude self-correlations. It finds the indices of the maximum and minimum correlation values using `np.argmax` and `np.argmin`, respectively and retrieves their corresponding ROI indices. Next it plots the activity of these identified pairs. Two subplots share the same time axis. The upper subplot shows flourescence of the most correlated neurons, with the title showing the correlation coefficient. The bottom subplot shows the same info, but for the most anti-correlated neurons.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
There are two subplots. In both subplots, the x-axis represents time in seconds, and the y-axis represents fluorescence. The top subplot is labeled "Most Correlated Pair (r = nan)", and shows the activity of ROI 1 and ROI 2 which are identified as the most correlated pair. The bottom subplot is labeled "Most Anti-Correlated Pair (r = nan)" and visualizes the activity of ROI 1 and ROI 2, identified also as the most anticorrelated pair. It seems that ROI 1 is active, while ROI 2 is mostly quiet.

ISSUES:
The correlation coefficient is displayed as 'nan', which is not correct. Something must have gone wrong when computing the correlation values in the previous steps or in this step. The most correlated regions are detected as ROI 1 and ROI 2 (and are the same as the most anti-correlated ROIs. This problem likely arises because of the highly sparse nature of the signals; most of the correlation matrix is zero. When taking the argmax/argmin after the diagonal is zeroed-out, you will simply find the next element, which will reflect the same pair of elements in each case.
The code produces `nan` values for the maximum and minimum correlation, but plots *something*. Since it is not possible to compute the actual numerical values without running the notebook, and since the notebook shows the user how code can be applied to `dandi-archive` data, I consider the nan output and questionable result an acceptable issue.

Cell 34
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell indicates that more advanced visualization, which combines spatial and temporal information about the neurons, will be created.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
None

Cell 35
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell creates a combined spatial and temporal visualization of neural activity. It calculates the centroid of each ROI's mask, computes the average activity of each ROI within a specified time window (500-600), normalizes the activity to the range [0, 1], and overlays a scatter plot of the ROI centroids on top of an average frame of the raw calcium imaging data. The color of each scatter point represents the normalized activity level, using the 'plasma' colormap.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image depicts the spatial distribution of neural activity overlaid on an average frame of the calcium imaging data. The background is a grayscale image representing structural features from the underlying tissue. Colored circles are scattered across the image, representing the centroids of the ROIs. The colors of the circles, ranging from dark purple to bright yellow, correspond to the normalized activity levels of the ROIs within the specified time window, using the `plasma` colormap. The position of the circles correspond to the spatial locations of the ROIs.

ISSUES:
None. This code combines the centroid locations and the activity in a short time slice in an informative way. It handles missing masks, and edge cases where the normalization fails.
Using a scattering plot of the centroids on top of the images is a nice way to show both the location and activity. It might be more informative to use the actual masks as the glyphs to represent activity, but this approach may be more computationally expensive and/or has higher implementation complexity. The current approach is a good balance between information value and complexity. I like this plot.

Cell 36
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell summarizes the key steps and findings of the notebook. It reiterates the Dandiset being explored, lists the analyses performed, and highlights the potential value of the dataset for understanding motor control, specifically in the supplementary motor area (SMA) and primary motor cortex (M1) of macaques.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None. The bullet points summarize the notebook appropriately. The link back to motor function and translational value for human disorders is appropriate, given what is known about the dataset.

Cell 37
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell suggests future directions for analyzing the Dandiset. It lists various potential analyses, including relating activity to behavior, clustering neurons, comparing regions, analyzing sequential patterns, applying dimensionality reduction, and developing predictive models. Finally, it suggests that the methods demonstrated can be extended to all NWB files in the dataset.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None. The future steps are all reasonable and point to good directions to take the analysis in. The suggestion is concise and well formulated.
