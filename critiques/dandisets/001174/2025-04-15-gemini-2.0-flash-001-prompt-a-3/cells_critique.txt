ISSUES:
None.

Cell 14
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell specifies the NWB file (`sub-Q/sub-Q_ophys.nwb`) that will be loaded and used for subsequent analysis. It provides a clear indication of which file is being used.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None.

ISSUES:
None.

Cell 15
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell downloads and loads the NWB file specified in the previous cell using `remfile` and `h5py`, and then reads it into a `pynwb.NWBFile` object. The `url` variable points to the download location of the NWB file on the DANDI archive. This cell is essential for accessing the data within the NWB file.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None.

ISSUES:
None.

Cell 16
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell serves as a transition, indicating that the following cells will inspect the metadata of the loaded NWB file.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None.

ISSUES:
None.

Cell 17
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell accesses and displays several metadata attributes of the `nwb` object, including `session_description`, `identifier`, `session_start_time`, and `timestamps_reference_time`. This allows the user to get a quick overview of the experiment.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None.

ISSUES:
None. Specifically, only the output of the last call (`nwb.timestamps_reference_time`) is displayed after the `OUTPUT-TEXT:`. The outputs of the other calls, namely `nwb.session_description` and `nwb.identifier`, are not displayed. This could lead to a false sense that the notebook is not working.


Cell 18
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell introduces a section focused on visualizing the calcium imaging data.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:

ISSUES:
None.

Cell 21
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell introduces the next step: visualizing the mean intensity of the calcium imaging data over time. This provides a clear indication of the plot that will be generated.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None.

ISSUES:
None.

Cell 22
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell calculates the mean intensity of the calcium imaging data across all pixels for each time point.  It then generates a plot showing the mean intensity over time.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The plot shows a time series of mean calcium imaging intensity. The x-axis represents time in seconds, and the y-axis represents mean intensity. The plot displays a relatively stable baseline with several sharp, downward spikes in intensity. The title is "Mean Calcium Imaging Intensity over Time," and the axes are labeled "Time (s)" and "Mean Intensity."

ISSUES:
The prominent downward spikes in the plot are unusual and might indicate an artifact or issue with the data processing or the data itself. It would be helpful to have some context about why these spikes occur (e.g., are they blink artifacts? Are they expected due to experimental manipulations?). Their cause is not clear from this plot alone. The spikes may also overshadow any meaningful changes in the calcium signal.

Cell 23
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell introduces and sets up visualizing single trial data from the calcium imaging data, specifying that the first 100 frames will be used.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None.

ISSUES:
None.

Cell 24
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell extracts the first 100 frames of the calcium imaging data, calculates the mean intensity over time, and plots the result. The code is very similar to the overall mean intensity but is focused on a smaller time window.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The plot shows the mean calcium imaging intensity over time for the first 100 frames, labeled as "Trial 1." The x-axis represents time in seconds, while the y-axis represents mean intensity. The plot shows a fluctuating pattern with an overall increase followed by a decrease in intensity.

ISSUES:
The title of the plot, "Mean Calcium Imaging Intensity over Time for Trial 1", is misleading as there is no prior definition of a Trial, nor is it necessarily one trial of an experiment. The notebook only shows the first 100 frames, which need not correspond to one Trial. A more informative title would describe that this is from the first 100 frames of the recording. The lack of explanation of how these frames relate to "trials" in the experiment limits the usefulness of the plot.

Cell 25
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell introduces a new visualization to inspect spatial masks.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None.

ISSUES:
None.

Cell 26
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell extracts the image masks from the PlaneSegmentation object in the NWB file and displays a heatmap representing the maximum value across spatial masks for each pixel. This allows visualization of the spatial distribution of the identified cells or regions of interest.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The plot, titled "Image Masks," displays a heatmap representing the spatial masks. The image consists of yellowish blobs on a dark purple background. These blobs represent the spatial locations and shapes of the identified cells or regions of interest. The axes do not have explicit labels.

ISSUES:
While the plot shows the spatial masks, it could benefit from more context. Specifically, the user may need help understanding how to interpret this max projection. Are these independent spatial filters? Is this from segmenting cells? What do the values mean? Are these aligned to the original imaging data? More information should be provided to help the user interpret this data.

Cell 27
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell introduces a section dedicated to summarizing the notebook's content and suggesting potential future directions for analysis.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None.

ISSUES:
None.
