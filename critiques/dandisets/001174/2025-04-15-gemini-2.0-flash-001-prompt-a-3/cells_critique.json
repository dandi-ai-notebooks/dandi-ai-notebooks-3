    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell expands on the initial title by providing a brief overview of the Dandiset (001174). It specifies that the data consists of calcium imaging from the SMA and M1 regions of macaque monkeys performing rest and arm reaching tasks. It also mentions the use of miniature microscopes to collect the data. This cell provides useful context for the rest of the notebook.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone.\n\nISSUES:\nNone.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell acts as a section header, indicating that the following content will describe the specific topics covered in the notebook. It helps the reader understand the notebook's scope.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone.\n\nISSUES:\nNone.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell lists the topics covered in the notebook. It includes connecting to the DANDI archive and accessing the Dandiset, loading metadata and data from an NWB file, visualizing the calcium imaging data, and optionally visualizing single-trial data. This gives the user a clear expectation of what they will learn.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone.\n\nISSUES:\nNone.",

    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell imports the necessary Python libraries for interacting with the DANDI archive, reading NWB files, handling data, and creating visualizations. This is a standard setup step for a data analysis notebook.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone.\n\nISSUES:\nNone.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces a section focused on loading the Dandiset using the DANDI API client.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone.\n\nISSUES:\nNone.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell describes the process of connecting to the DANDI archive, retrieving the Dandiset with the ID \"001174\", and listing the first few assets to identify NWB files. It provides a high-level explanation of the code that will follow.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone.\n\nISSUES:\nNone.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell uses the DandiAPIClient to connect to the DANDI archive and retrieve Dandiset \"001174\". It then lists the first five assets within the Dandiset, printing their paths. This is a crucial step for exploring the contents of the Dandiset.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone.\n\nISSUES:\nNone.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces a section focused on loading metadata and data from an NWB file within the Dandiset.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone.\n\nISSUES:\nNone.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell specifies the NWB file (`sub-Q/sub-Q_ophys.nwb`) that will be loaded and used for subsequent analysis. It provides a clear indication of which file is being used.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone.\n\nISSUES:\nNone.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell downloads and loads the NWB file specified in the previous cell using `remfile` and `h5py`, and then reads it into a `pynwb.NWBFile` object. The `url` variable points to the download location of the NWB file on the DANDI archive. This cell is essential for accessing the data within the NWB file.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone.\n\nISSUES:\nNone.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell serves as a transition, indicating that the following cells will inspect the metadata of the loaded NWB file.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone.\n\nISSUES:\nNone.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell accesses and displays several metadata attributes of the `nwb` object, including `session_description`, `identifier`, `session_start_time`, and `timestamps_reference_time`. This allows the user to get a quick overview of the experiment.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone.\n\nISSUES:\nNone. Specifically, only the output of the last call (`nwb.timestamps_reference_time`) is displayed after the `OUTPUT-TEXT:`. The outputs of the other calls, namely `nwb.session_description` and `nwb.identifier`, are not displayed. This could lead to a false sense that the notebook is not working.\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces a section focused on visualizing the calcium imaging data.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone.\n\nISSUES:\nNone.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell explains that the upcoming code will load calcium imaging data from a `OnePhotonSeries` object and plot a subset of it.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone.\n\nISSUES:\nNone.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell retrieves the calcium imaging data from the \"OnePhotonSeries\" acquisition within the NWB file and prints the shape of the data array.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone.\n\nISSUES:\nNone.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the next step: visualizing the mean intensity of the calcium imaging data over time. This provides a clear indication of the plot that will be generated.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone.\n\nISSUES:\nNone.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell calculates the mean intensity of the calcium imaging data across all pixels for each time point.  It then generates a plot showing the mean intensity over time.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe plot shows a time series of mean calcium imaging intensity. The x-axis represents time in seconds, and the y-axis represents mean intensity. The plot displays a relatively stable baseline with several sharp, downward spikes in intensity. The title is \"Mean Calcium Imaging Intensity over Time,\" and the axes are labeled \"Time (s)\" and \"Mean Intensity.\"\n\nISSUES:\nThe prominent downward spikes in the plot are unusual and might indicate an artifact or issue with the data processing or the data itself. It would be helpful to have some context about why these spikes occur (e.g., are they blink artifacts? Are they expected due to experimental manipulations?). Their cause is not clear from this plot alone. The spikes may also overshadow any meaningful changes in the calcium signal.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces and sets up visualizing single trial data from the calcium imaging data, specifying that the first 100 frames will be used.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone.\n\nISSUES:\nNone.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell extracts the first 100 frames of the calcium imaging data, calculates the mean intensity over time, and plots the result. The code is very similar to the overall mean intensity but is focused on a smaller time window.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe plot shows the mean calcium imaging intensity over time for the first 100 frames, labeled as \"Trial 1.\" The x-axis represents time in seconds, while the y-axis represents mean intensity. The plot shows a fluctuating pattern with an overall increase followed by a decrease in intensity.\n\nISSUES:\nThe title of the plot, \"Mean Calcium Imaging Intensity over Time for Trial 1\", is misleading as there is no prior definition of a Trial, nor is it necessarily one trial of an experiment. The notebook only shows the first 100 frames, which need not correspond to one Trial. A more informative title would describe that this is from the first 100 frames of the recording. The lack of explanation of how these frames relate to \"trials\" in the experiment limits the usefulness of the plot.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces a new visualization to inspect spatial masks.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone.\n\nISSUES:\nNone.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell extracts the image masks from the PlaneSegmentation object in the NWB file and displays a heatmap representing the maximum value across spatial masks for each pixel. This allows visualization of the spatial distribution of the identified cells or regions of interest.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe plot, titled \"Image Masks,\" displays a heatmap representing the spatial masks. The image consists of yellowish blobs on a dark purple background. These blobs represent the spatial locations and shapes of the identified cells or regions of interest. The axes do not have explicit labels.\n\nISSUES:\nWhile the plot shows the spatial masks, it could benefit from more context. Specifically, the user may need help understanding how to interpret this max projection. Are these independent spatial filters? Is this from segmenting cells? What do the values mean? Are these aligned to the original imaging data? More information should be provided to help the user interpret this data.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces a section dedicated to summarizing the notebook's content and suggesting potential future directions for analysis.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone.\n\nISSUES:\nNone.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell provides a summary of the key steps covered in the notebook: connecting to the DANDI archive, loading an NWB file, and visualizing mean intensity over time. It also suggests future analysis directions, such as analyzing individual cell activity, performing spike detection and sorting, and correlating neural activity with behavior.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone.\n\nISSUES:\nNone."
