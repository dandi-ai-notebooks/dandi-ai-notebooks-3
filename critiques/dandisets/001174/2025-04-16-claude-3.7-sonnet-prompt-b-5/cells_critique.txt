Cell 14
==========

OVERVIEW:
This markdown cell introduces the section dedicated to exploring the raw calcium imaging data stored in the `OnePhotonSeries` object within the NWB file.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 15
==========

OVERVIEW:
This code cell extracts and prints information about the `OnePhotonSeries` object from the NWB file. It displays the data's shape, data type, frame rate, description, and unit. It also retrieves and prints information about the associated imaging plane, including its description, excitation wavelength, imaging rate, and the description and manufacturer of the device used. This cell provides essential information about the raw imaging data's dimensions, properties, and acquisition parameters.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 16
==========

OVERVIEW:
This markdown cell summarizes the dimensions of the raw imaging data based on the previously printed shape of `one_photon_series.data`. It states the number of frames, the pixel dimensions of each frame, and the acquisition frame rate. It then previews the upcoming visualization of a few frames of the raw data.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
The code references `one_photon_series.data.shape` and `one_photon_series.rate` without defining them inside of the markdown. This will work as written due to the prior code cell defining them. However, it would be better to either rewrite it in a way that does not depend on variable substitution, or to redefine the variables in this cell again. I would recommend the former.


Cell 17
==========

OVERVIEW:
This code cell visualizes a single frame from the raw calcium imaging data. It retrieves a frame at index 1000 from the `one_photon_series.data`, displays it using `plt.imshow` with a grayscale colormap, and adds a colorbar for reference. The plot also includes a title indicating the frame number and axis labels. This provides a visual representation of the raw imaging data.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image is a grayscale representation of a calcium imaging frame. It shows a rectangular area with varying shades of gray, representing fluorescence intensity. There are some slightly brighter spots scattered throughout the image, which might correspond to cells or other structures with higher calcium activity within the field of view. A colorbar on the right side of the image maps the gray shades to fluorescence intensity values, ranging from approximately 700 to 2800. The title above the image indicates that it is a raw calcium imaging frame from frame 1000.

ISSUES:
None

Cell 18
==========

OVERVIEW:
This markdown cell provides an interpretation of the visualized frame, explaining that bright spots likely represent neurons and their fluorescence intensity reflects calcium concentration. It then prefaces the next step: examining multiple frames to observe activity changes over time.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 19
==========

OVERVIEW:
This code cell displays four frames of raw calcium imaging data at different time points in the recording. It iterates through a list of frame indices (`frame_indices`) and plots each frame in a 2x2 subplot arrangement. Each frame is displayed with a grayscale colormap, a colorbar, a title indicating the frame number and corresponding time in seconds (calculated using the frame rate), and with the axes turned off. This allows for visual comparison of the raw data across different timepoints to observe potential changes in activity.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image shows four grayscale calcium imaging frames arranged in a 2x2 grid. Each subplot represents a frame captured at a specific time point (Frame 500 at 50.0s, Frame 1000 at 100.0s, Frame 2000 at 200.0s, and Frame 3000 at 300.0s). The fluorescence intensity is represented by the gray shades, with brighter areas indicating higher calcium activity. The images show a similar overall structure, with varying intensities and patterns of bright spots across each frame. A colorbar is present next to each frame illustrating the fluorescence intensity scale. The axes are turned off, focusing the viewer's attention on the image data.

ISSUES:
None

Cell 20
==========

OVERVIEW:
This markdown cell introduces the next section, which focuses on examining the regions of interest (ROIs) identified in the imaging data. It explains that these ROIs represent potential neurons and prepares the reader for exploring the ROI information.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 21
==========

OVERVIEW:
This code cell retrieves the `ImageSegmentation` and `PlaneSegmentation` objects from the NWB file. It then prints the number of ROIs identified and the shape of the ROI masks stored in `plane_segmentation.image_mask`. This provides information about the number of segmented cells and the spatial dimensions of their corresponding masks.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 22
==========

OVERVIEW:
This markdown cell states the number of ROIs based on the `len(plane_segmentation)` value obtained in the previous code cell. It introduces the upcoming visualization of the ROI masks, giving the user context for the next code cell.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
Similarly to a point made earlier, the code references `len(plane_segmentation)` without defining it inside of the markdown. This will work as written due to the prior code cell defining them. However, it would be better to either rewrite it in a way that does not depend on variable substitution, or to redefine the variables in this cell again. I would recommend the former.

Cell 23
==========

OVERVIEW:
This code cell visualizes the masks of the first nine ROIs, or fewer if there are less than 9 ROIs, as a 3x3 grid of subplots. For each ROI, the corresponding mask from `plane_segmentation.image_mask` is displayed using `plt.imshow` with a 'hot' colormap. Each subplot includes a title labeling the ROI number and suppresses the axes. The `min` function ensures that the code doesn't try to plot more ROIs than are available.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image presents ROI masks in a 3x3 grid. Each subplot shows a single ROI mask, visualized with a 'hot' colormap. The masks appear as small, localized regions of high intensity (red/yellow) against a black background. The intensity likely corresponds to the probability of a pixel belonging to the ROI. Each subplot is titled with the ROI number (ROI 0 through ROI 8). The ROIs appear to represent small, distinct areas corresponding to individual neurons.

ISSUES:
The shape of the ROI masks is (40, 292, 179), but each `mask` in the loop is only two-dimensional with only one channel. We are not utilizing the weights of the mask. This is technically correct, but could be improved by summing the weights across the first dimension, so we can visualize the full activity of the ROI mask.

Cell 24
==========

OVERVIEW:
This markdown cell explains that the ROI masks represent individual neurons, with intensity values (presumably between 0 and 1) indicating the strength of association with the ROI. It then sets up the transition to the next step: creating a composite image showing all ROIs overlaid to visualize their spatial distribution.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 25
==========

OVERVIEW:
This code cell creates and visualizes a composite image of all ROI masks. It initializes a zero-filled array (`composite_mask`) with the same shape as an individual ROI mask. Then, it iterates through all ROI masks in `plane_segmentation.image_mask`, and for each pixel, `np.maximum` takes the higher value between the current pixel intensity in `composite_mask` and the corresponding pixel intensity in the current ROI mask. This effectively overlays all masks, showing the maximum intensity at each pixel across all ROIs. Finally, the resulting `composite_mask` is displayed using `plt.imshow` with a 'hot' colormap, and labeled with a title, colorbar, and axis labels.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image shows a composite view of all ROI masks, where each ROI is represented by a region of varying color intensity on a black background. The "hot" colormap represents areas of overlap, with hotter (yellower) colors representing higher degrees of overlap and red and orange representing areas where only one or a few ROIs are present. The ROIs are spread across a rectangular field of view. A colorbar maps the color intensities to "ROI mask intensity" values, ranging from 0 to 1. The image provides a quick visualization of where the ROIs are located relative to each other in the field of view.

ISSUES:
This code could be improved by addressing the same issue noted in the last code block: The shape of the ROI masks is (40, 292, 179), but each `mask` in the loop is only two-dimensional with only one channel. We are not utilizing the weights of the mask. This is technically correct, but could be improved by summing the weights across the first dimension, so we can visualize the full activity of the ROI mask.

Cell 26
==========

OVERVIEW:
This markdown cell addresses a potential discrepancy between the dimensions of the ROI masks and the raw imaging frames. It explains that this is a common occurrence due to the segmentation process often being performed on preprocessed data (e.g., motion-corrected data). This helps to anticipate and explain a possible observation to the user.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 27
==========

OVERVIEW:
This code cell explicitly prints the dimensions of the raw imaging frames and the ROI masks, allowing direct comparison and confirming the potential discrepancy mentioned in the preceding markdown cell.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 28
==========

OVERVIEW:
This markdown cell introduces the section on analyzing neural activity. It mentions that the NWB file contains both raw fluorescence traces and processed event amplitude data, and prepares the reader for exploring these data types.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 29
==========

OVERVIEW:
This markdown cell focuses the analysis specifically on the fluorescence data, setting the context for the following code.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 30
==========

OVERVIEW:
This code cell extracts the fluorescence data from the NWB file. It retrieves the `Fluorescence` and `RoiResponseSeries` objects, extracts the fluorescence data itself, and obtains the sampling rate. It then prints the shape of the fluorescence data, the sampling rate, and the duration of the recording. Finally, it checks for and reports the number of NaN (Not a Number) values in the data, along with the percentage of NaN values relative to the total data size.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 31
==========

OVERVIEW:
This markdown cell acknowledges the presence of NaN values reported in the previous cell and explains the rationale for the next step: verifying the validity of the data for each ROI.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 32
==========

OVERVIEW:
This code cell calculates the number of NaN values for each ROI in the fluorescence data. It calculates the sum of NaN values along the time axis (axis=0) and stores it in `nan_count_per_roi`. It then prints the NaN count for the first 10 ROIs, followed by a message indicating the presence of additional ROIs. This informs which ROIs might be problematic due to missing data.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 33
==========

OVERVIEW:
This markdown cell concludes the examination of NaN values in fluorescence data, reassuring that the small fraction is acceptable. It then transitions to the next section of the analysis, focusing on event amplitude data.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 34
==========

OVERVIEW:
This markdown cell introduces the analysis of event amplitude data. It explains that event amplitude data represents detected calcium events and is often considered more reliable for analysis than raw fluorescence. This motivates the shift in focus to event amplitudes.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 35
==========

OVERVIEW:
This code cell retrieves the event amplitude data from the NWB file. It accesses the `EventAmplitude` object and extracts the event data. It then prints the shape of the event amplitude data and checks for NaN values, reporting the number and percentage of NaN values in the dataset.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 36
==========

OVERVIEW:
This markdown cell notes the absence of NaN values in the event amplitude data and suggests it is more suitable for subsequent analysis. It introduces the next step: plotting event amplitude traces for a selected set of ROIs.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 37
==========

OVERVIEW:
This code cell generates and displays event amplitude traces for a selected set of ROIs over the first 200 seconds of the recording. It creates a time vector based on the sampling rate, selects five ROIs, and iterates through them, plotting the event amplitude trace for each ROI with a vertical offset to separate them visually. The plot is labeled appropriately, showing the time on the x-axis, the event amplitude (with offset) on the y-axis, and the ROI identifiers in the legend. The `frames_to_plot` variable calculation is robust by ensuring it does not exceed the length of the data.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image displays event amplitude traces for five selected ROIs (0, 5, 10, 15, and 20) over the first 200 seconds of the recording. Each ROI's activity is represented by a separate line, vertically offset from the others. The x-axis represents time in seconds, while the y-axis shows the event amplitude (in arbitrary units) plus the offset. The offset separates traces. The legend in the bottom right corner indicates corresponding Roi # and color. These traces appear fairly sparse, with many periods of low or no activity, punctuated by sudden spikes in activity. ROI 15 appears to have much more activity on average than the others and have a noisy texture. The others have distinct spikes.

ISSUES:
None

Cell 38
==========

OVERVIEW:
This markdown cell interprets the plotted event amplitude traces. It explains that the sharp peaks represent calcium events, likely corresponding to action potentials. It also highlights the variability in activity patterns across different ROIs, including differences in overall activity levels and firing patterns.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 39
==========

OVERVIEW:
This markdown cell suggests examining the aggregated activity across all neurons to observe the overall network activity, by summing event amplitudes at each time point.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 40
==========

OVERVIEW:
This code cell calculates and visualizes the total neural activity across all ROIs over time, and highlights periods of high activity. First, it sums the event amplitudes across all ROIs at each time point using `np.sum` along axis 1. This `total_activity` represents the overall network activity pattern. Then, it plots the `total_activity` over time, with appropriate axis labels and title. Furthermore, it identifies periods of high activity by calculating the 95th percentile of the total activity (`activity_threshold`) and defining any time points above this threshold as periods of high activity. Finally, it replots the total activity trace adding a horizontal line depicting the `activity_threshold`, and scatter points to mark these high activity periods.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The first image displays the total neural activity across all ROIs over time. The x-axis represents time in seconds, and the y-axis represents the sum of event amplitudes across all ROIs. The plot shows a fluctuating activity pattern with several peaks and troughs.

The second image is similar to the first, but adds highlighted periods of high activity. A dashed red horizontal line depicts the high activity threshold, and red scatter points mark the time points (x-axis) at which the total activity exceeds this threshold. This highlights the most active periods in the recording.

ISSUES:
None

Cell 41
==========

OVERVIEW:
This markdown cell interprets the plots of total neural activity. It explains that the peaks represent coordinated network activity, and the highlighted periods of high activity might correspond to behavioral events or internal state changes.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 42
==========

OVERVIEW:
This markdown cell introduces the next step in the analysis: calculating correlations between the activity of different ROIs. It suggests this will help to identify functional relationships between neurons.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 43
==========

OVERVIEW:
This code cell calculates and visualizes the correlation matrix between the event amplitude data of a subset of ROIs (first 20). It initializes an empty correlation matrix. Then, using nested loops, it calculates the Pearson correlation coefficient between each pair of ROIs in the subset using `pearsonr` from `scipy.stats`. The correlation values are assigned to the corresponding elements in a matrix while making sure to preserve the symmetry. Finally, it visualizes the correlation matrix using the `seaborn` library's `heatmap` function, annotating with correlation coefficients, using 'coolwarm' colormap, set bounds, ROI IDs as axis labels, and then displaying the plot.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image presents a heatmap of the correlation matrix between the activity of the first 20 ROIs. The x and y axes represent the ROIs. The color of each cell indicates the Pearson correlation coefficient between the corresponding pair of ROIs, with "coolwarm" colormap. Red represents positive correlations, blue represents negative correlations, and gray represents near-zero correlations. The diagonal elements are all dark red, indicating perfect positive correlation of each ROI with itself. Most off-diagonal elements are near-zero (gray). There are a few light-colored off diagonal elements representing weak correlations of both positive (red) and negative (blue) value.

ISSUES:
The code throws `ConstantInputWarning` warning when `pearsonr` is provided with an input that is constant. This occurs when the activity of an ROI is zero for the entire duration. Since the analysis does not address this situation, the output plot is misleading due to the presence of non-defined values in the heatmap. The code needs to handle these cases, by either excluding the constant ROIs, or explicitly setting `corr_matrix[i, j]` to zero.

Even though not explicitly incorrect, I think it is a bit misleading to calculate the correlation using *all* timepoints. It is very possible that the recorded animal was performing a movement task and/or being presented with stimuli at certain times. The correlation during those times is probably most relevant. A further extension of this notebook might be to only calculate the correlation at specific times in the recording.

Cell 44
==========

OVERVIEW:
This markdown cell interprets the correlation matrix plot. It explains that strong positive correlations (red) indicate neurons active at the same time, while negative correlations (blue) suggest neurons active at different times. It also notes that clusters of neurons with similar activity patterns may represent functional cell assemblies or networks within the recorded region.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
The conclusion, "We can identify clusters of neurons with similar activity patterns," is not really supported by the visualization, which shows that *most* elements are near-zero, which actually makes this conclusion almost the opposite: there does not appear to any clear clustering of neuronal activity. The statement should be revised in light of the generated visualization in the current cell.

Cell 45
==========

OVERVIEW:
This markdown cell introduces a more advanced analysis step: identifying neuron ensembles. It states that these ensembles can be identified by examining correlation patterns.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 46
==========

OVERVIEW:
This code cell aims to visualize neuronal ensemble relationships based on correlation values. It creates a custom plot. The X-axis contains ROI IDs 0-19 with an invisible Y-axis. A line indicates a correlation between the two connecting ROIs, and is only displayed if the absolute value of the Pearson correlation is larger than 0.3. Red lines are positive correlation; blue lines are negative correlation.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image is essentially blank. ROI 0-19 labels are printed (horizontally) along the bottom. However, there are no connecting lines displayed, indicating a Pearson correlation less than 0.3 between neurons. This is likely because there are constant inputs, resulting in `NaN` values for the Pearson correlation.

ISSUES:
Because the underlying correlation data is flawed (due to constant inputs in the data as described in previous cells), the `corr_matrix` values are also flawed (including many `NaN` values). Therefore, the results of the procedure are incorrect, and in particular the absence of any connections in the visualization is not a valid conclusion from the data. This greatly diminishes the validity of the cell's analysis.

This is likely due to a `ConstantInputWarning`; if the activity of an ROI is zero for the entire duration, then there is no correlation. The code needs to handle these cases, by either excluding the constant ROIs, or explicitly setting `corr_matrix[i, j]` to zero. A simple way of handling this would be to add a check after the call to `pearsonr` that verifies that the returned values are not `NaN`, and then set to zero/skip accordingly.

Cell 47
==========

OVERVIEW:
This markdown cell attempts to interpret the (blank) graph in the previous cell, as a dendrogram, and the entire description is therefore incorrect.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
The description in this cell does not describe the plot in the previous cell, and is therefore completely incorrect. The previous cell produced a scatterplot, not a dendrogram. Furthermore, nothing was shown in it. This entire description is therefore inaccurate. The text should be revised in light of the actual image produced.

As noted in prior cells, the constant activity, causes incorrect calculation of the correlation matrix, and causes these subsequent cells to be misleading.

Cell 48
==========

OVERVIEW:
This markdown cell provides a summary of the notebook's content and outlines potential future analysis directions. It recaps the steps performed: loading and examining the NWB file, visualizing raw data and ROIs, analyzing neural activity patterns, and exploring correlations between neurons. It also outlines several potential avenues for future investigation, including correlating neural activity with behavior, comparing activity patterns across sessions or brain areas, applying dimensionality reduction techniques, and analyzing the temporal dynamics of neural events.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
The conclusion, "The data reveals clear patterns of neural activity, with distinct events visible in individual neurons and periods of coordinated activity across the population.", is only partially supported by the visualizations. Several aspects of the analysis had issues, and in particular the network analysis showed almost no network activity, which partially contradicts this conclusion. The statement should be revised in light of the generated visualizations in the current cells.

As noted in prior cells, the constant activity, causes incorrect calculation of the correlation matrix, and causes these subsequent cells to be misleading.
