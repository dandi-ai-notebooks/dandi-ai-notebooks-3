    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell provides an introduction to the Dandiset (000945) that the notebook will explore. It describes the experiment, data acquisition methods, subject details, and file naming conventions. It also outlines the notebook's objectives, which include loading and exploring the Dandiset, accessing metadata, visualizing electrophysiology data, and examining trial information. Finally, it lists the required Python packages. This cell sets the stage for the rest of the notebook by giving context and providing a roadmap.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell uses the `dandi` library to connect to the DANDI archive, retrieve the Dandiset with ID \"000945\", and list the available assets (NWB files) within the Dandiset. It prints the total number of assets and the paths of the first five assets to give the user an overview of the data organization.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the next step: loading metadata and data from an NWB file within the Dandiset. It specifies that the first NWB file in the assets list (`sub-BH497/sub-BH497_ses-20240310T143729_ecephys.nwb`) will be used for demonstration. It also mentions that the NWB file is stored remotely and that `remfile` will be used for data streaming. This sets up the following cells where the NWB file will actually be loaded and its contents explored.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nThe notebook states that it will use the first NWB file listed, which is `sub-BH497/sub-BH497_ses-20240310T143729_ecephys.nwb`. However, the previous cell (when run) prints the first five assets, and none of them match this name. This discrepancy between what the notebook *says* it will do and what the previous cell shows is an issue. The subsequent code *might* refer to the correct asset based on the code itself, but the markdown introduction is confusing and requires correction.\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell loads the NWB file for analysis. It imports necessary libraries (`pynwb`, `h5py`, `remfile`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `pandas`, and `seaborn`), defines the URL for the NWB file, uses `remfile` and `h5py` to handle the remote file, then uses `pynwb` to read the NWB file into the `nwb` object. Finally, it displays the `nwb` object, which shows a summary of the NWB file's contents, including fields like `devices`, `electrode_groups`, `subject`, and `trials`.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\n1.  **Inconsistency with Previous Cell**: The previous cell indicated that the NWB file `sub-BH497/sub-BH497_ses-20240310T143729_ecephys.nwb` would be loaded. However, the URL used in this cell corresponds to a different file: judging by its `identifier`, it's `BH498_3000_200_anes`. This is a significant discrepancy. The notebook claims it will load one file, but loads another. This introduces confusion and inaccuracy.\n2.  **Warnings**: The output includes `UserWarning` messages related to conflicting versions of `hdmf-common`, `core`, and `hdmf-experimental`. While not necessarily critical errors, these warnings indicate potential dependency management problems that should be addressed for a clean and reproducible environment.\n",

    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces a section focused on loading and visualizing spike times data. It explains that spike times and cell type labels will be loaded from the `units` table. It states that only the first 10 units will be loaded to reduce the amount of data processed.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell generates a scatter plot of spike times for the first 10 units. It first converts the `nwb.units` table into a Pandas DataFrame and takes the first 10 rows. It then extracts the 'spike_times' and 'celltype_label' columns. The plotting loop iterates through each unit, plotting the spike times as a horizontal scatter plot, with the y-axis representing the unit index. The color of each spike corresponds to the unit's `celltype_label`, as indicated by the legend.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe image is a scatter plot titled \"Spike Times for First 10 Units\". The x-axis is labeled \"Time (s)\" and the y-axis is labeled \"Unit Index\". There are 10 horizontal lines of scattered points representing the spike times for each of the first 10 units. Each line represents a unit index from 0 to 9. The points are colored according to cell type labels, with a legend in the upper right corner indicating which color corresponds to which `celltype_label` (1.0 or 2.0).\n\nISSUES:\n1. **Overlapping Labels**: The labels in the legend overlap each other, making it difficult to read which color represents which cell type.\n2. **Uninformative Plot**: The plot shows the spike times for each unit over the entire duration of the recording. Without any indication of the tFUS stimulation times, it\u2019s difficult to glean any meaningful information about the effect of stimulation on spiking activity. The relationship between the scatter points and the \"horizontal lines\" should have been improved to enhance the plot. A raster plot would have displayed information better.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the next analysis step: loading and visualizing trial start and stop times. It states the intention to load trial information from the `trials` table and create a plot. It also mentions that only the first 10 trials will be used to limit the data volume.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell generates a plot of trial start and stop times. It loads the first 10 trials from the `nwb.trials` object into a Pandas DataFrame, extracts the `start_time` and `stop_time` columns, and uses `plt.vlines` to plot vertical lines at the start and stop times of each trial. The y-axis represents the trial and is intentionally left unlabelled using `plt.yticks([])`.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe image is a plot titled \"Trial Start and Stop Times for First 10 Trials\". The x-axis is labeled \"Time (s)\" and the y-axis is labeled \"Trial\", but there are no tick marks on the y-axis. Vertical green lines indicate the start times of the trials, and vertical red lines indicate the stop times. There are 10 pairs of green and red lines, corresponding to the first 10 trials.\n\nISSUES:\nThe plot is not particularly informative as is. The trials are plotted sequentially, but the y-axis provides no information because the numbered ticks are removed. The figure is ok for a very basic tutorial. Ideally, this plot should be combined with the spike times to allow a visual correlation between the tFUS stimulation and spiking activity.\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell summarizes the notebook's key achievements, reiterating how to load and explore the Dandiset 000945, access NWB files, load metadata, and visualize electrophysiology and trial data. It also suggests potential directions for future analysis, such as in-depth electrophysiology analysis, investigating the effects of ultrasound stimulation, comparing activity across conditions, and analyzing other NWB files in the Dandiset.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nThe notebook suggests comparing neural activity *across different PRFs*. However, the notebook only analyzes *one* NWB file, so it does not demonstrate at all how to access the *different* NWB files that contain data for the other PRFs. This is a significant omission. The notebook says \"Loading metadata from a selected NWB file\", when it really means \"Loading metadata from *a single, hardcoded* NWB file\".\n"
