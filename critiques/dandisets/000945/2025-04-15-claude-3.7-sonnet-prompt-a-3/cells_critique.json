This cell provides crucial background information for understanding the data and analysis presented later in the notebook.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: None\n",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell outlines the planned analyses and visualizations to be performed in the notebook. It provides a roadmap for the user, listing the key steps: data loading, metadata examination, spike timing analysis, visualization creation (raster plots, PSTHs, spike rate changes), cell type comparison, and visualization of trial-to-trial variability. This cell serves as a guide for the rest of the notebook.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: None",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell introduces the section that will list the necessary Python packages for running the notebook. It serves as a preamble before providing the actual package list.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: None",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell imports the necessary Python libraries for data analysis and visualization. It imports NumPy for numerical operations, Matplotlib and Seaborn for plotting, Pandas for data manipulation, SciPy for statistical analysis, h5py for reading HDF5 files, remfile for accessing remote files, pynwb for working with NWB files, and DandiAPIClient for interacting with the DANDI Archive. It also sets plotting defaults using Seaborn and adjusts the figure size.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: None\n",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell introduces the section where the DANDI Archive dandiset is loaded. It acts as a heading for the following code that performs the loading.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: None",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell connects to the DANDI Archive using the `DandiAPIClient` and retrieves the dandiset with ID \"000945\". It then lists the first five assets (NWB files) found within the dandiset. This provides a quick overview of the files included in the dataset.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: None",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell is a transition to the section that will explore the dandiset metadata. It provides context for the subsequent steps.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: None",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell retrieves and prints the Dandiset's metadata, including the identifier and current version. It also prints the name, description, and license information. This provides key information about the dataset, enhancing the user's understanding.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: None",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell introduces the section that will load and explore an NWB file from a specific subject (BH497).\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: None",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell loads a specific NWB file from the DANDI Archive using its URL. It utilizes `remfile` and `h5py` to access the remote file and `pynwb` to read the NWB structure. It then prints basic information about the session and the subject from the NWB file, including session description, identifier, start time, institution, subject ID, species, sex, age, and description. The subject ID in the URL is BH498 but the subject information from NWB file is BH497, which is confusing.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: The subject ID in the variable `url` is BH498, but the subject information from the NWB file is BH497. This discrepancy should be investigated and corrected for consistency. The warnings related to namespace versions are also worth investigating to ensure compatibility but are not critical for this initial exploration.",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell introduces the examination of electrode information from the NWB file.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: None",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell extracts electrode information from the NWB file and presents it in a Pandas DataFrame. It displays the first few rows of the DataFrame, showing electrode properties like x, y, z coordinates, impedance, location, filtering, group, and group name. Additionally, it iterates through electrode groups and prints their descriptions, locations, and device information. This cell provides insight into the recording setup used in the experiment.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: The electrodes DataFrame displays 'unknown' for location and filtering. It would be better if the notebook could access and display the actual location information. However, this might not be available in all NWB files, making it a limitation of the data rather than the analysis. The DataFrame is displayed using `display()`, which may not work correctly in all environments (e.g., a standard script). Consider using `print(electrodes_df.head())` for broader compatibility.",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell introduces the examination of trials information, specifically related to ultrasound stimulation.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: None",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell extracts trial information from the NWB file and presents it as a Pandas DataFrame. It prints the total number of trials and the trial description. It also displays the start and stop times of the first five trials. The cell calculates trial durations and prints statistical values of the trial durations (mean, median, min, max, standard deviation). Finally, a histogram of trial durations is plotted, including a vertical line indicating the mean duration.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: The image is a histogram showing the distribution of trial durations. The x-axis represents the duration in seconds, and the y-axis represents the count of trials. The histogram appears empty, showing essentially a vertical line along the y-axis with mean marked as 2.2 seconds. The title of the plot is \"Distribution of Trial Durations.\" A vertical dashed red line indicates the mean trial duration.\n\nISSUES: The histogram is misleading. The x-axis has very large values outside the meaningful scale (order of 1e12+2.2). The count of trials for all bins will likely be 500 around the 2.2 duration and 0 elsewhere. This arises from the bins not being correctly set to capture any variation around 2.2 seconds. Also `trials_df['duration'].std()` is 0, suggesting that every trial has exactly same duration. The histogram x-axis should reflect the expected range of values centered at 2.2, and the code should verify that duration is close to 2.2 for all trials.",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell introduces the section where information about recorded neurons (units) will be examined.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: None",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell extracts information about the recorded neurons (units) from the NWB file and presents it as a Pandas DataFrame. It prints the total number of units, the description of the 'units' table, and the column names. It displays the first few rows of the DataFrame, showing spike times and cell type labels for each neuron. It then counts the number of units for each cell type and plots the distribution of cell types as a bar graph.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: The image is a bar graph showing the distribution of cell types. The x-axis represents the cell type labels (1.0 and 2.0), and the y-axis represents the count of neurons for each cell type. There are two bars, one for each cell type, both with a height of approximately 32, indicating an equal number of neurons for cell type 1.0 and 2.0. The title of the plot is \"Distribution of Cell Types.\"\n\nISSUES: The notebook does not explain what celltype_label 1.0 or 2.0 refer to. It would be helpful to display the labels along with the counts of number of units per celltype so it is interpretable. Although the counts are equally distributed, this could be a result of the file or an artifact of the particular stage of processing used to generate the data. This needs to be clarified with domain expertise and included in the notebook for the content to be readily interpretable by others.",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell introduces the section where spike timing around the ultrasound stimulation events will be analyzed using raster plots and peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs).\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: None",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell begins the process of analyzing spike timing by outlining the extraction of spike times for each neuron.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: None",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell defines a function `get_spike_times` to extract the spike times for a given unit index from the `units_df` DataFrame. It then retrieves the spike times for the first 5 units (or fewer if there are less than 5 units) and stores them in the `unit_spike_times` list. The cell prints the number of spikes, cell type, the first 5 spike times, mean interspike interval (ISI), and the mean firing rate for each of the selected units. The total recording time is computed to calculate the firing rate.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: The code is well-structured and extracts relevant information. However, the formula used to calculate mean firing rate may not be representative. It would be more appropriate to divide the trial into segments equal to the pulse repetition frequency. The approach utilized in the current notebook measures against the entire duration of the experiment/recording. However, it might be appropriate to calculate (a) firing rate only during the ultrasound pulse (67 ms), (b) baseline/inter-trial firing rate when ultrasound is NOT present, and (c) overall mean, as computed in the current notebook. This refinement would permit calculating the relative effects of ultrasound on firing rate with greater statistical confidence. Further domain expertise may be warranted to ensure that proper methods are employed.",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell introduces the creation of raster plots and peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs) to visualize neural responses to ultrasound stimulation, focusing on units with interesting responses.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: None",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell selects units for further analysis based on their spike counts. It identifies the 10 most active units and then chooses the top 3 most active units from that group to be analyzed in detail. The selected units and their properties (spike counts, cell type) are printed.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: None",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell transitions to the creation of raster plots and PSTHs for analyzing the selected units.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: None",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell defines a function `plot_raster_and_psth` to generate a raster plot and a peri-stimulus time histogram (PSTH) for a given unit. The function takes the unit index, trials DataFrame, an optional axes object, and a bin size as input. The function aligns spike times to the start of each trial, plots the raster plot, calculates and plots the PSTH, and includes a vertical line indicating stimulation onset, and a horizontal line indicating mean firing rate. The cell then iterates through the selected units, calls the `plot_raster_and_psth` function to generate the plots for each unit, and displays the resulting figure with the raster and PSTH for each analyzed unit.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: The image contains three pairs of raster plots and PSTHs, one pair for each analyzed unit (34, 31, and 30). Each row displays a raster plot on the left and a PSTH on the right.\n\n- **Raster Plots:** Each dot represents a spike, with the x-axis indicating time relative to the stimulation onset (0 seconds) and the y-axis representing the trial number. The vertical dashed red line indicates the stimulation onset.\n\n- **PSTHs:** The x-axis represents time relative to the stimulation onset (0 seconds) and the y-axis represents firing rate in spikes per second. The vertical dashed red line indicates the stimulation onset. The horizontal dashed green line indicate the average firing rate for each neuron. The plot appears to show increased firing rate around the time of stimulus.\n\nISSUES: The raster plots appear very dense. They might benefit from some form of smoothing or aggregation to make patterns more visible. The PSTHs show relatively small changes in firing rate around the stimulation onset compared with the overall firing rate. It may be appropriate to refine how firing rate is calculated (as noted in the previous cell's review). The choice of `pre_stim_time` and `post_stim_time` may not be ideal and might need adjustment based on the experimental design and observed neural responses. The plots would benefit from indicating statistical significance of the effect of the ultrasound stimulation.",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell introduces the section focusing on quantifying changes in neural firing rates in response to ultrasound stimulation by comparing pre and post-stimulation periods.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: None",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell analyzes the change in neural firing rates in response to ultrasound stimulation. It defines time windows before, immediately after, and later after the stimulation onset. The code calculates the firing rate for each neuron in each of these time windows across all trials within. The percent change relative to the pre-stimulation period is computed, and a paired t-test is performed to assess the statistical significance of these changes. The results, including the mean firing rates, percent changes, and p-values, are stored in a Pandas DataFrame (`results_df`). Finally, the code prints a summary of the results, including the mean percent changes in firing rate and the number of units with significant changes in each time window.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: The analysis appears generally sound, but the mean change values (0.09% and 0.24%) are very small, although some individual units have significantly-different firing rates according to the t-test. It would be more meaningful if this cell performed a sign test to determine if there is an effect of ultrasound being excitatory (+ change) or inhibitory (- change). It would improve clarity if the 'total_spikes' column was incorporated into the final descriptive statistics, e.g. \"Analyzed X units with > Y mean spikes/trial\" and units with very few spikes were displayed separately from units generating sufficient spikes for a robust statistical analysis. It also doesn't appear that this code can distinguish between Type 1 and Type 2 neurons meaningfully (i.e. the numbers are similar), which undermines the overall purpose of the notebook as identified in the section \"What We'll Cover\", namely \"Compare responses across different cell types\". While the code appears to be functional and correct, the underlying parameters and approach need refinement.",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell introduces visualizations of the distribution of firing rate changes, categorizing the results by cell type.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: None",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell generates boxplots to visualize the distribution of firing rate changes for each cell type (early and late responses). The x-axis of the boxplots represents the cell type, and the y-axis represents the percent change in firing rate. A horizontal red dashed line is included at y = 0 for reference. The plots allow for a comparison of the distribution of firing rate changes between the two cell types in both the early and late response windows.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe image contains two boxplots side-by-side:\n\n- **Left Boxplot (Early Response):** The x-axis shows cell types (1.0 and 2.0), and the y-axis shows the percent change in firing rate during the early response (0-100ms). Both boxplots are centered near Y=0, with outliers ranging from -17 to 17.\n\n- **Right Boxplot (Late Response):** Similar to the left plot, the x-axis shows cell types (1.0 and 2.0), and the y-axis shows the percent change in firing rate during the late response (100-500ms). Again, both boxplots are centered near Y=0, with outliers ranging from -7.5 to 10.\n\nIn both plots, a red dashed line is plotted at y=0.\n\nISSUES: The boxplots do not reveal a clear distinction of change in neuronal firing rates for type 1 and type 2 neurons in response to ultrasound. Despite the paired t-test indicating statistical significance of firing rate increase/decrease in select/individual neurons, in aggregate, the population response is centered around zero. Either ultrasound has no effect, the selected time windows are inappropriate, or the method used to measure change in firing rate relative to baseline is not appropriate. This calls into question the cell's ability to compare \"responses across different cell types\" as highlighted in the section \"What we'll Cover\". There is no conclusive evidence to suggest different responses for the two different cell types, suggesting this notebook is falling short of its stated goals. It is possible that more robust statistical analysis can reveal more subtleties. In the current form, these boxplots are not very informative.",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell introduces the section that will visualize trial-to-trial variability in neural responses using a heatmap of firing rates for each trial.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: None",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell analyzes the trial-to-trial variability in neural responses for a selected unit. It first selects a \"responsive\" unit, prioritizing units with significant early responses, or defaulting to the most active unit if none have significant early responses. The code then generates a heatmap showing the firing rate of the selected unit across all trials and time bins. A second plot is generated showing the mean firing rate over time, incorporating the standard error of the mean. Also on this second plot a vertical line indicates stimulation onset.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: The output displays two plots:\n\n1.  **Firing Rate Heatmap:** The image is a heatmap showing the firing rate of a single neuron (Unit 19) across all trials. The x-axis represents time from the stimulation onset (-0.5 to 1 second), and the y-axis represents trial number (0 to 500). The color intensity indicates the firing rate (spikes/sec) with a colorbar on the right. The vertical red dashed line indicates the time of stimulation.\n\n2.  **Mean Firing Rate Plot:** The image plots the mean firing rate over time for Unit 19. The x-axis represents time from stimulation onset (-0.5 to 1 second), and the y-axis represents the firing rate (spikes/sec). The solid blue line represents the mean firing rate, and the shaded blue area represents the standard error of the mean. A vertical red dashed line indicates the time of stimulation. This plot's y-axis values range from 12 spikes/sec \u2013 33 spikes/sec, and the shape of the blue curve indicates depressed firing rates in the period between x= ~0.75-1.0 seconds.\n\nISSUES: The selected responsive unit appears to be chosen from `early_sig`, however it might make sense to prioritize selection in response to \"Analyzing Trial-to-Trial Variability in Neural Responses\" and choose from the group of most active units as it is likely these units will have the most informative response and largest effect size to be used in a heatmap. The heatmap itself is difficult to interpret directly, although trial-to-trial variability is evident based on changes in false color. The mean firing plot includes error bars which adds confidence in the measurement given the large amount of trial-to-trial noise. Also, the mean firing rate plot could be improved if there were confidence intervals along the mean firing rate with a different color and line thickness. Also, it can be difficult to interpret how much the ultrasound effects the firing rate changes; it can be improved if the plot included the mean firing rate of trials when there was no ultrasound present. Furthermore, it is also difficult to determine visually if ultrasound stimulation results in statistically-significant overall up or down regulation of the mean firing rate for the selected neuron for all trials. The notebook could benefit if it reported in the text whether the selected neuron was up- or down-regulated by ultrasound stimulation. It is also possible that different neurons may be up- or down-regulated, which further statistical analysis could identify. It would also be beneficial to display the raster plot for this unit to contextualize the heatmap results visually. Overall, while functional and correct, the content in the cell can be refined significantly to improve interpretation within the notebook and for others seeking to understand the experimental results.",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell transitions to a comparison of how different cell types respond to the ultrasound stimulation, restating one of the primary goals of the notebook.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: None",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell compares the responses of different cell types to the stimulation. It groups the results from the previous analysis by cell type and calculates descriptive statistics (mean, standard error of the mean, and count) for the early and late percent changes in firing rate. It then generates horizontal bar plots showing the means and standard errors of the percent changes in firing rate for each cell type in both the early and late response windows. Also, the descriptive statistics for the pre, early post and the late post of each cell type is summarized in a table.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: The image contains a table and two horizontal bar plots:\n\n-   **Table:** Provides a summary of the means, standard errors of the mean (SEM), and counts for early and late percent changes in firing rate, as well as mean pre-stimulation rate, mean early post stimulation rate and mean late post stimulation rate for each cell type (1.0 and 2.0).\n\n-   **Horizontal Bar Plots:** The left plot displays values for the early responses (0-100ms) and the right plot displays values for the late responses (100-500ms). Both plots display a vertical dashed red line at x=0 indicates no change in firing rate as reference, together with bar plots showing average percent change in firing rate vs baseline values (x=0 at reference). Sample sizes are indicated by the \"n\" number beside each bar. Again, these values are close to baseline (x=0).\n\nISSUES: The horizontal bar plots (with mean and SEM error bars) provide a good visualization for comparing the early and late response by cell type. However, no clear distinction can be observed and the plot might not be very informative since the values for both cell types are close to x=0, even with error bars. Also the note that tight layout not applied means elements are likely overlapping. It is very difficult to distinguish both cell types, so the notebook fails in showing how \"responses (differ) across different cell types\". Perhaps reporting also the p-values between cell types can supplement this visualization and further confirm that there is probably no distinct difference between cell types, leading to a different approach for the notebook. Furthermore, this visualization could also directly show the actual firing rate and not simply the percent changes, therefore providing more interpretability as the user can readily assess its value given this context. Furthermore, the horizontal axis is inconsistent; the left plot goes from x=-1.5 to x=1.5; the right plot has scale from x=-0.4 to x=1.0. This creates confusion. An overall analysis of the entire notebook finds that it is not very insightful given these limitations.",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell provides a summary of the analyses performed in the notebook and the key findings. It also outlines potential future directions for research using this dataset.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: Some of the claims in this summary are not strongly supported by the analysis performed. Specifically, the claim that \"Different cell types showed varying responses to the stimulation\" is not clearly demonstrated based on the visualizations. It lacks details to support this claim and could have been more robust in the analysis sections (e.g. statistical significance, confidence measures). The other key findings are supported by the content and visualizations presented."
