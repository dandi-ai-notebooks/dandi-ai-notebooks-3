    "OVERVIEW: This cell provides the title of the Jupyter notebook: \"Exploring Dandiset 000945: Neural Spiking Data in the Awake Rat Somatosensory Cortex Responding to Trials of Transcranial Focused Ultrasound Stimulation\". It introduces the specific Dandiset that will be explored in the notebook and briefly describes the type of data and experimental paradigm within the dandiset. This cell serves as an introduction and sets the context for the rest of the notebook.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: None\n",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell provides a disclaimer, indicating that the notebook was AI-generated and may not be fully verified. This is important for the user to understand the limitations of the notebook's content.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: None\n",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell provides a textual overview of the notebook's purpose and content. It reiterates the Dandiset being explored (000945), briefly mentions the experimental context (neural spiking data in awake rat somatosensory cortex responding to transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation), and outlines the key steps that will be performed: loading the Dandiset, loading and visualizing trial data, and loading and visualizing spiking data. It also provides a link to the Dandiset on Neurosift, which is helpful for users who want to explore the data interactively.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: The Neurosift link is incorrect; it points to dandiset 001176/000945, which is not a valid dandiset identifier. It should only be 000945.\n",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell lists the Python packages required to run the notebook. This is essential for users to ensure they have the necessary dependencies installed before attempting to execute the code.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: None\n",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell introduces the section dedicated to loading the Dandiset. It serves as a heading and provides context for the subsequent code cell.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: None\n",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell uses the `dandi` library to connect to the DANDI archive and retrieve the specified Dandiset (000945). It then lists the first 5 assets (NWB files) within the Dandiset. This cell demonstrates how to access and explore the contents of a Dandiset programmatically.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: None",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell introduces the section focused on loading and visualizing trial data. It specifies the NWB file (`sub-BH497/sub-BH497_ses-20240310T143729_ecephys.nwb`) that will be used for this demonstration and provides a direct URL to download it from the DANDI archive. This helps the user to reproduce the steps outlined in the code.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: The subject ID in the asset path (`sub-BH497`) differs from that in the previously listed assets (`sub-BH498`). This may cause confusion, as the user might expect to be working with data from a single subject. The URL appears valid but leads to a specific asset. This is not necessarily an issue, but it could be more informative to select assets consistently across all cells, perhaps picking one that is representative of the entire dataset.\n",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell loads an NWB file from a URL, retrieves the trial start and stop times, calculates the trial durations, and visualizes the distribution of these durations using a histogram.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: The image displays a histogram showing the distribution of trial durations. The x-axis represents the trial duration in seconds, ranging from 2.0 to 2.4 seconds. The y-axis represents the number of trials. There are two bars in the histogram: one centered around 2.15 seconds and another centered around 2.25 seconds. The bar at 2.25 seconds is significantly taller than the one at 2.15 seconds, indicating that there are more trials with a duration around 2.25 seconds than around 2.15 seconds. The histogram has a title \"Distribution of Trial Durations,\" and the axes are labeled \"Trial Duration (s)\" and \"Number of Trials.\"\n\nISSUES:\n1.  The `bins` parameter in `plt.hist` is set to `[2.1, 2.2, 2.3]`. This creates only two bins, which might be too coarse to accurately represent the distribution. A larger number of bins would provide a more detailed view.\n2.  The x-axis limits are explicitly set using `plt.xlim(2.0, 2.4)`. While this can improve visualization, it is important to make sure that the chosen limits do not clip any significant portion of the data. In this case, the x-axis limits are appropriate given the bins and data.\n3.  The warnings about cached namespaces can be safely ignored.\n4.  It would be better to specify the bin width instead of explicit bins.",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell provides a textual interpretation of the histogram generated in the previous cell. It summarizes the distribution of trial durations, noting the two distinct groups and approximate number of trials in each.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: The description aligns with the histogram plot from the previous cell. However, the boundaries are slightly off due to previously defined bin parameters. The intervals should be described as 2.1-2.2 and 2.2-2.3.",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell introduces the section on loading and visualizing spiking data. It states the goal of visualizing the number of spikes per unit.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: None",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell retrieves the spiking data (spike times, cell type labels, and unit IDs) from the NWB file loaded in a previous cell. It then iterates through the first 10 units and calculates the number of spikes for each, storing this information in a list. Finally, it generates a bar plot visualizing the number of spikes per unit for the first 10 units.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: The image shows a bar plot of the number of spikes per unit for the first 10 units. The x-axis represents the Unit ID, ranging from 0 to 9. The y-axis represents the Number of Spikes. The bar heights vary, indicating different numbers of spikes for different units. Some units have around 12,000-16,000 spikes, while units 8 and 9 have a substantially higher number of spikes at around 30,000 and 23,000 respectively. The plot is titled \"Number of Spikes per Unit (First 10 Units),\" and the axes are labeled \"Unit ID\" and \"Number of Spikes.\"\n\nISSUES:\n1.  The line `spike_times_for_unit = nwb.units['spike_times'][i]` is attempting to index the 'spike_times' column, but that column stores each spike time series as an individual column; thus the code is trying to access the column with index `i`. Instead it should index into the `spike_times` *column* and retrieve the *element* at index `i`. Corrected line: `spike_times_for_unit = nwb.units['spike_times'][i]`\n2.  The printout of unique cell types is not very informative because it renders as 1.0 and 2.0 instead of the actual cell type labels. The actual labels should be extracted and printed.\n",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell provides a textual description of the bar plot generated in the previous cell. It summarizes the approximate range of spike counts observed for the first 10 units.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: The description is an accurate summary based on the bar plot from the previous cell. The range description is accurate for the visualized units. However, since there were issues with how the data was accessed in the previous cell, there may be inaccuracies in the plot.\n",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell provides a summary of what the notebook covered and suggests potential directions for future analysis. It mentions further exploration of spiking data, analysis of the relationship between ultrasound stimulation and neural activity, and comparison of neural activity across different experimental conditions.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: None"
