    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell provides an introduction to the notebook and the Dandiset being analyzed (000945). It includes a disclaimer about the AI-generated nature of the notebook, a high-level summary of the experimental data (tFUS stimulation in rats), the dataset's Neurosift link, and an outline of the notebook's content. It also lists the required packages, setting the stage for the subsequent code execution.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell imports the necessary Python libraries for data analysis, visualization, and interaction with the DANDI archive. It imports libraries such as numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, pandas, h5py, remfile, pynwb, dandiapi, scipy, and warnings. It also configures the plotting style using seaborn and suppresses warnings.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the process of loading the Dandiset from the DANDI archive and states the dandiset id being used.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell connects to the DANDI archive, retrieves Dandiset \"000945\", and lists the first five assets within the Dandiset. It prints the Dandiset name and the number of assets found. The printed list of assets shows the file paths, which appear to be NWB files organized by subject and session.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the next step, which is to organize and examine the subjects and sessions within the dataset.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell organizes the assets by subject. It iterates through the assets, extracts the subject ID from the file path, and groups the files accordingly. It then prints the number of subjects and lists the first three files for each subject, along with the total number of files for each subject. This provides a good overview of the experimental design and data structure.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the next step, which involves loading and examining the structure of a specific NWB file. It specifies the subject (BH497) associated with the file. It also states that the file has a 3000 Hz pulse repetition frequency, which is important context. However, the filename isn't explicitly stated - it will need to be determined in the next cell based on the description.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nThe markdown specifies the use of \"the file from subject BH497 with a 3000 Hz pulse repetition frequency\", but does not show how this file is selected. This selection based on pulse repetition frequency probably happens later in the notebook. It might be helpful to clarify this point.\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell loads a specific NWB file using its asset ID. It defines the asset ID and constructs the file path and URL. It then uses `remfile` and `h5py` to load the file remotely and `pynwb` to read the contents into an `nwb` object.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nThe previous cell mentioned the file should have a 3000 Hz pulse repetition frequency, but there's no explicit check or connection made here to ensure the selected file matches this criteria. The notebook simply loads a file without verifying its characteristics. This could be a potential issue if the subsequent analysis relies on this assumption. Also, it could be improved by describing how the specific NWB file to be analyzed was selected.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the examination of the NWB file's metadata.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell prints the NWB file's metadata, including the file identifier, session description, session start time, institution, and subject information (ID, age, sex, species, and description).\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nThe file identifier `BH498_3000_200_anes` seems inconsistent with the selected file path `sub-BH497/sub-BH497_ses-20240310T143729_ecephys.nwb` and subject id `BH497`. The file identifier even contains `BH498`, which is a different subject id listed earlier. This inconsistency requires investigation. The session description also offers some clues, so it might be possible to work backwards to correct this error if one exists.\n\nThe session start time is useful, as it enables the user to reconcile the file path in code with the session start time in the description.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell sets the stage for examining electrode and device information stored within the NWB file\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell iterates through the devices and electrode groups in the NWB file and prints their descriptions and manufacturers/locations. It shows that there's one device named \"array\" (Neuronexus probe) and one electrode group named \"shank1\" located in the brain area.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nThe electrode location is \"brain area\", which lacks specificity. However, this limitation likely reflects the information available in the NWB file. It would be valuable to know what brain area corresponds to the location of shank1.\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the examination of the electrode data.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell converts the electrode information in the NWB file into a Pandas DataFrame, making it easier to view and manipulate. It prints the number of electrodes and displays the first five rows of the DataFrame, showing the x, y, z coordinates, impedance, location, filtering information, and the electrode group.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nThe x, y, and z coordinates seem odd (they are all small values) but this is not necessarily an error. However, it would be better to have more specific location information than \"unknown\". The group_name column may not be the most useful as printed, since all the group names are 'shank1elec[number]'. It would be more useful to see the actual shank number. The electrodes_df.head() output is difficult to read due to the column width limitations.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the examination of trial data relating to the ultrasound stimulation.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell converts the trial information in the NWB file into a Pandas DataFrame. It prints the number of trials and displays the first five rows of the DataFrame, showing the start and stop times for each trial.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nThe output indicates that only the start_time and stop_time columns are present. It is likely that the trials table also contains information about the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) or other stimulation parameters. If this information is present, it should be displayed and used in the following analyses. If not, this is a significant omission, since the notebook claimed to focus on the effects of different PRFs. It is not possible to tell without further information.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell calculates trial durations and inter-trial intervals from the trial start and stop times. Then, it generates histograms displaying the distributions of these metrics.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe figure contains two subplots.\nThe first subplot shows a \"Trial Duration Distribution\". The x-axis indicates the duration in seconds (s), and the y-axis indicates the counts. The majority of the data points fall within a narrow range. The x axis scaling is flawed, and the data lies outside the graphed interval.\nThe second subplot shows an \"Inter-Trial Interval Distribution\". The x-axis indicates the interval in seconds (s), and the y-axis indicates the counts. The distribution appears more uniform.\n\nISSUES:\nThe x-axis scale of the \"Trial Duration Distribution\" plot is incorrect. The x-axis label shows \"1e-12+2.2\", but the values the the plot x-axis are near -2. This suggests a significant error in either the data or the plotting procedure. It's impossible to interpret the trial duration from this plot. The notebook should have checked the trial duration data for errors. The inter-trial interval plot's x-axis is on the correct scale. Moreover, it is concerning that the cell drops the last inter-trial interval by calling `.dropna()`. While there will be no inter trial interval *after* the last trial, this should not be a `nan` value. It should be ignored during downstream statistical tests. The `.dropna()` might have unintended consequences later. The lack of trial-specific information (e.g., PRF) in the trials_df (as noted in the previous assessment) is a major concern here, because there is no way to stratify trials into different conditions.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the analysis of neural unit data, highlighting the availability of spike times and cell type labels.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell converts the neural unit data into a Pandas DataFrame. It prints the number of units and lists the columns present in the DataFrame. The columns include 'spike_times' and 'celltype_label'.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nGiven the previous issues, it is concerning that there is no way to link these neural units to specific electrode locations, i.e. to the channels/electrode groups. Without that information, it will be hard to tell which part of the brain the probe recorded from. Ideally this would link to the electrodes dataframe from before. It will also be challenging to determine the source of these spike times if it is impossible to link back to the original .dat file. Also, no sampling_rate metadata is shown here, which would be needed to interpret this data appropriately. Overall, not enough metadata is being accessed or displayed here, so conclusions cannot confidently be drawn.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell maps numerical cell type labels to descriptive labels (\"RSU\" and \"FSU\") and calculates the proportion of RSU and FSU units.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nThe code relies on a hardcoded mapping of cell type labels to descriptions (1: 'RSU', 2: 'FSU'). While this might be correct for this specific dataset, it's not a generalizable approach. Ideally, this mapping would be read from the NWB file itself, if the information exists there.\n\nGiven previous concerns about linking the neural units to their source, it is not be possible to replicate these cell types based on features of the raw data, so it is important that this mapping be accurate, as we may not be able to verify the labels.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the analysis of spike times for example neurons.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell defines a helper function `get_unit_spike_times` to extract spike times for a given unit ID. It then selects the first three units as examples, retrieves their spike times and cell types. It calculates and prints the total spikes, time range, and mean firing rate for each unit.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nThe code calculates the mean firing rate by dividing the total number of spikes by the difference between the last and first spike times. This is an approximation of the firing rate over the *observed* time range. A more precise calculation would use metadata from the trials table, because it provides more accurate \"start_time\" and \"stop_time\" columns. The time range varies per neuron, as shown by the output, but the trial durations are constant. Using the trial structure, the spike rates could be accurately measured per individual trial. The code does not link these firing rates to ultrasound stimulation parameters, or relate them to specific trials. This severely restricts the conclusions that can be drawn.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces visualizing spike activity around ultrasound stimulation using raster plots and PSTHs. This is where the analysis is most relevant to the notebook\u2019s stated goals.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell defines a function `create_raster_and_psth` that generates a raster plot and peri-stimulus time histogram (PSTH) for a given unit around the stimulus onset. It takes the unit ID, a time window, and a bin size as input. The function extracts spike times for the unit, aligns them to trial start times, and generates the raster plot and PSTH. It also adds vertical lines to indicate stimulus onset and offset.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nThe function is well-structured and documented. However, it does *not* account for different stimulation parameters (e.g., PRF). It averages neural responses across all trials, regardless of the specific ultrasound settings used in each trial. The prior issues, such as the trial duration distributions being wrong and the lack of a column defining PRF, are now catching up to this analysis. Also, the x-axis range is not very useful, since it spans from -0.5 to 1.5 seconds. Given the trials only last 2.2 seconds, this means that a substantial part of the graph displays the ITI for nearly every trial. Finally, the y-axis for the trial number has no apparent ticks, so it is impossible to tell how many trials have been plotted, or the trial number.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the analysis of example units using the previously defined function.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell identifies the units with the most spikes for analysis. It calculates the number of spikes for the first 5 units, sorts them in descending order, and prints the unit ID, cell type, and spike count for each.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nThis cell only looks at the first 5 units. The raster_and_psth function is not computationally expensive and runs very quickly, so it would make sense to extract the unit spike counts for *all* units. Also, given the concerns about linking the neural units and the trial metadata (pulse frequencies of ultrasound stimulation), it is unclear why the notebook proceeds with additional cells, because the PSTH will not be meaningfully compared against different trials. These issues should be addressed.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell calls the `create_raster_and_psth` function with unit ID 0 to generate and display the raster plot and PSTH for that unit.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe figure contains two subplots.\nThe first subplot titled \"Unit 0 (FSU (Fast Spiking Unit)) - Raster Plot\" shows raster dots arranged chronologically by trial # (y-axis). The x-axis indicates time. A red vertical dashed line indicates stimulus onset, and a blue vertical dashed line indicates stimulus offset. This figure seems to show the neural activity of a single neuron plotted with no regard for pulse frequency variations.\n\nThe second subplot titled \"Peri-Stimulus Time Histogram (PSTH)\" shows a histogram of the firing rate (y-axis) against time from stimulus onset (x-axis). The x- and y-axes are as described in the Raster Plot. This shows that the stimulus does not modulate activity from this neuron.\n\nISSUES:\nThe raster plot and PSTH show no clear modulation of neural activity related to the stimulus. This is not surprising, given the cell's earlier failure to account for different stimulation parameters. The plot averages across all trials with different PRFs, effectively obscuring any potential effects. Also, as previously stated, the raster has no apparent y-axis tick marks. Finally, while the stimulus offset is plotted on the graph, the x-axis range exceeds its range, so the stimulus offset is printed outside of the active scanning window.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell generates and displays a raster plot and PSTH for unit ID 1, allowing for comparison with the previous unit.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe figure contains two subplots.\nThe first subplot titled \"Unit 1 (RSU (Regular Spiking Unit)) - Raster Plot\" shows raster dots arranged chronologically by trial # (y-axis). The x-axis indicates time. A red vertical dashed line indicates stimulus onset, and a blue vertical dashed line indicates stimulus offset. This figure seems to show the neural activity of a single neuron plotted with no regard for pulse frequency variations.\n\nThe second subplot titled \"Peri-Stimulus Time Histogram (PSTH)\" shows a histogram of the firing rate (y-axis) against time from stimulus onset (x-axis). The x- and y-axes are as described in the Raster Plot. This shows that the stimulus does not modulate activity from this neuron.\n\nISSUES:\nSimilar to the previous cell, the raster plot and PSTH show no clear modulation of neural activity related to the stimulus. The concerns articulated previously also apply here. It appears that the activity of this neuron is not modulated by the stimulus when responses are averaged across all stimuli. The notebook should have investigated the metadata to resolve these issues. Otherwise the PSTH has very little value.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell sets the stage for comparing neural responses across different cell types (RSU vs FSU)\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nGiven that previous cells do not link responses to stimulation parameters, and that single-trial data is homogenized through the PSTH, any cell type comparison has very little value, since it is not possible to determine if any differences are stimulus-selective. These issues should be resolved.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell defines a function `calculate_response_metrics` to quantify neuronal responses by calculating pre- and post-stimulus firing rates and a modulation index. It performs a paired t-test to assess the statistical significance of the response.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nThis function shares the same fundamental flaw as the PSTH: it averages responses across all trials, regardless of stimulation parameters. It's impossible to know whether neurons are responding to *specific* ultrasound settings or just exhibiting general activity changes. The statistical analysis (paired t-test) is also problematic because it assumes independence between trials, which is unlikely given the experimental design. Also, to reiterate, the concerns about incorrectly plotted trial duration distributions from several cells back have still not been solved. Finally, the code implicitly assumes that each trial has a paired pre-stimulus and post-stimulus window and that no data is skipped. The code has no fault tolerance to confirm this fact, and it may break down if the user extracts a subsample of trials. These facts call the analyses into question.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell calculates response metrics (pre- and post-stimulus firing rates, modulation index, p-value) for all units using the `calculate_response_metrics` function. It converts the results into a Pandas DataFrame and adds a 'response_type' column based on the modulation index and statistical significance.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nThe issues from the previous cells propagate here. The fact that the analysis averages across all trials, therefore ignoring the ultrasound parameter settings is a fatal flaw. Any interpretations from this dataframe have very little value.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the analysis of response type distributions across cell types.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nThe concerns from the previous cells propagate here. Given that the ultrasound pulse frequencies are not accounted for, and that data errors regarding trial duration have not yet been resolved, the subsequent analysis will have very little value. The issues must be resolved before proceeding.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell generates a stacked bar chart showing the distribution of response types (Enhanced, Suppressed, No Response) for each cell type (RSU, FSU). It also annotates the chart with the total number of units per cell type.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe image is a stacked bar plot with \"Cell Type\" on the x-axis and \"Percentage of Units\" on the y-axis. There are two bars, one for each cell type (FSU and RSU). The bars are stacked by response type: Enhanced (light grey), No Response (light green), and Suppressed (salmon). The labels \"n=32\" are printed above each bar. The RSU bar shows that about 100% of the neurons are non-responsive, while the FSU graph shows that about 93% of the neurons are non-responsive and ~7% are suppressed.\n\nISSUES:\nThe plot indicates that almost all units are classified as \"No Response,\" with a very small fraction being \"Suppressed\" for FSUs. However, given the flawed methodology of averaging across all trials irrespective of stimulation parameters, this result is meaningless. It may be the artefact of combining all pulse frequencies into a single average in cells back. This obscures any insights into differential responses between cell types based on stimulus characteristics. The notebook set out to show these relationships, but does not do so.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell generates a boxplot and swarmplot visualizing the distribution of the modulation index for each cell type (RSU and FSU). It also performs an independent samples t-test to compare the modulation indices between the two cell types and displays the p-value on the plot.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe plot displays the distributions of modulation indices for RSU and FSU neural recordings. Boxplots indicate the quartiles, and swarmplots overlay individual data points. A horizontal dashed line intersects the origin of the y axis. A t-test was performed comparing RSU and FSU modulation indicies, yielding *p* = 0.626. This shows no significant difference in modulation index based on cell type.\n\nISSUES:\nThe box plots show no significant differences in the medians between the RSU and FSU populations. However, given that the analysis does not the account for the ultrasound pulse frequency, along with the data quality issues described previously, this analysis is not particularly meaningful. Without addressing these issues, it\u2019s impossible to draw any valid conclusions from this plot. Also, the t-test performed is an independent samples t-test, which assumes that the two groups are independent. This is probably not the case, because the neurons were recorded at the same time, which has implications on the independence of the two groups. This is not addressed in the code, which may reduce the validity of the t-test.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the creation of a heatmap to visualize trial-to-trial variability in neural responses.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nThis analysis will fail to achieve its goals given all issues named so far. The notebook has not linked neural responses to different pulse frequencies, and therefore contains almost no relevant information to comment on. The code should be restructured before proceeding.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis defines the function `create_trial_heatmap`. It takes a given unit and extracts spiking data aligned to stimulus points. For each trial and each bin, it counts each spike and normalizes those counts to a firing rate by dividing by the bin size. It then plots a heatmap of firing rate vs. trial colored by firing rate.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nAs stated previously, and due to all the unresolved data quality issues, this analysis will fail to yield useful insight. By plotting an average which does not differentiate trials or pulse frequencies, the function will hide potentially valuable information. Morever, the x-axis is plotted relative to stimulus onset and truncated at 1.5 seconds, however the stimulus offset from `trial_df['standard_time'].median()` may be greater than 1.5 seconds. This may result in the exclusion of stimulus-evoked firing rate changes that are actually caused by the stimulus. Finally, since `tight_layout()` is called after the subplots have been constructed, the plots may be compressed together. Calling `tight_layout()` for each subplot may be more appropriate.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell selects the most statistically responsive unit, and runs the function `create_trial_heatmap()` on that unit. The cell adds a conditional such that if there are no responsive units, it uses unit 0.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe figure contains two connected plots.\nThe major plot displays trial number on the y-axis and time relative to ultrasound stimulus onset (s) on the x-axis. The major plot is a heatmap with the trial-wise firing rate of the neuron (Hz) represented by the plotted color at each time point. The major plot is bounded by a dashed red line at 0s representing the stimulus onset, and a dashed blue line representing the stimulus offset. The right-hand plot plots the mean firing rate on the x-axis against time relative to the stimulus onset on the y-axis.\n\nISSUES:\nThe heatmap does not provide any additional information due to the homogenization across stimulus types. All prior named issues apply here as well. The heatmap is not interpretable beyond saying that different trials evoke different firing rates. It does not give any conclusive insight into firing patterns between different neurons. Since the notebook set out to show and resolve these differences, this cell fails to reach that desired outcome.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell summarizes the content of the notebook and suggests directions for future analysis.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nThe summary is misleading, as it claims to have analyzed neuron responses to ultrasound stimulation and compared responses between different cell types meaningfully. Due to the notebook's failure to properly account for varying stimulation parameters, those claims are invalid. The suggested future directions are valid, but depend on fixing the fundamental issues with data handling and analysis.\n"
