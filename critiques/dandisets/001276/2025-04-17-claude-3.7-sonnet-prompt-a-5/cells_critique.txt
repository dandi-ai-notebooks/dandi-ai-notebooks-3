IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None
ISSUES: None

Cell 20
==========

OVERVIEW: This cell generates a visualization of the extracted central region of the image. It uses `matplotlib` to display the image data. It applies contrast stretching using `skimage.exposure.rescale_intensity` to enhance the visibility of features. The image is displayed with a colorbar, title, and axis labels.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: The image shows a 2000x2000 pixel section of the original image, displayed with a 'viridis' colormap. The x-axis and y-axis are labeled "Pixel Position." A colorbar on the right indicates the intensity values. The image itself appears to show cell structures, with variations in color representing different intensity levels. There are bright yellow areas scattered throughout the image, potentially indicating areas of high fluorescence. The contrast enhancement makes the fainter details more visible. The image shows a relatively uniform distribution of cells across the observed area and appears to be capturing individual and groups of cells.

OVERVIEW: This cell introduces the examination of intensity profiles across horizontal and vertical cross-sections of the image.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None
ISSUES: None

Cell 22
==========

OVERVIEW: This cell generates and displays intensity profiles across horizontal and vertical cross-sections of the image. It first displays the extracted image section, with red lines indicating the locations of the cross-sections. Then, it plots the intensity values along the horizontal and vertical lines as a function of pixel position. The plots are labeled with appropriate titles and axis labels.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: The figure displays three subplots in a row. The first subplot shows the same 2000x2000 image as in the previous cell, with a horizontal red line intersecting the middle of the image and a vertical red line intersecting the middle of the image. The second subplot shows a line graph representing the horizontal intensity profile. The x-axis is "Position (pixels)", and the y-axis is "Intensity". The line plot shows fluctuations in intensity, indicating areas of varying brightness along the horizontal cross-section. The third subplot shows the vertical intensity profile, with the same x and y axis. The line plot, again, represents intensity variations, this time along the vertical cross-section.

ISSUES: None

OVERVIEW: This cell introduces the next step, which involves comparing multiple regions of the image to understand the spatial distribution of fluorescence better.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None
ISSUES: None

Cell 24
==========

OVERVIEW: This cell divides the image into five regions (Center, Top, Bottom, Left, Right), extracts each region, and visualizes them in a grid. It calculates the average intensity, max intensity, min intensity, and standard deviation for each region. The average intensity for each region is displayed as part of the subplot title. Contrast stretching is applied to each region before visualization to enhance features.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: The figure displays five subplots arranged in a 2x3 grid (the last subplot is empty). Each subplot displays a 1000x1000 pixel region from the original image, visualized with a 'viridis' colormap and contrast stretching. Each subplot is titled with the region's name (e.g., "Center Region") and its average intensity. Colorbars are displayed to the right of each image. The images show varying degrees of intensity, with the "Center Region" appearing brightest and the "Right Region" appearing dimmest based on both average intensity and visual impression.

ISSUES: None

Cell 25
==========

OVERVIEW: This cell segues into visualizing the average intensities of the different regions using a bar plot.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None
ISSUES: None

Cell 26
==========

OVERVIEW: This cell creates a bar plot to visually compare the average intensities of the different image regions. It extracts the names and average intensities from the `region_stats` list generated in the previous cell. It then uses `seaborn.barplot` to create the bar plot, with region names on the x-axis and average intensity on the y-axis. The plot is labeled with a title and axis labels.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: The image is a bar plot that shows the average intensity for different regions of an image. The x-axis represents the region (center, top, bottom, left, and right) and the y-axis represents the average intensity. The "Center" region has the highest average intensity, followed by "Bottom", "Left", "Top", and "Right" regions.

It uses the same process as before: `remfile` for remote file access, `h5py` for HDF5 interaction, and `pynwb` to read the file. It then prints the subject ID and a snippet of the session description for the second file to facilitate a basic comparison.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None
ISSUES: None

Cell 29
==========

OVERVIEW: This cell sets the context for comparing the central regions of the two loaded images, suggesting that differences in electroporation patterns between conditions A and B might be revealed.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None
ISSUES: None

Cell 30
==========

OVERVIEW: This cell extracts and visualizes the central region from both NWB files (conditions A and B). It retrieves the dimensions for the second image, extracts the central region (2000x2000 pixels) from both, applies contrast stretching independently to each, and displays them side-by-side in a figure. The titles of the subplots include the subject ID for each condition.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: The image displays two subplots side-by-side. The left subplot shows the central region of the first image (condition A), while the right subplot shows the central region of the second image (condition B). Both are visualized using the 'viridis' colormap. Each subplot has a colorbar indicating intensity values and is titled with the subject ID. The two images appear qualitatively similar, but minor differences in the intensity or distribution of brighter spots might be present.

ISSUES: None

Cell 31
==========

OVERVIEW: This cell introduces the comparison of intensity histograms between the two images.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None
ISSUES: None

Cell 32
==========

OVERVIEW: This cell generates and displays intensity histograms for the central regions of the two images. It calculates the histograms using `numpy.histogram`, ensuring that both histograms use the same bin range, determined by the maximum intensity value across both images. The histograms are then plotted on the same axes using `matplotlib`, with different colors and labels indicating the subject ID for each condition.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: The image shows a plot of two intensity histograms. The x-axis represents the intensity, while the y-axis represents the pixel count. One histogram (blue line) represents the first image and the other (orange line) represents the second image. Both histograms peak at relatively low intensity values and then rapidly decline. The histograms start to diverge by intensities of approximately 6000, with the "P1_20240627_A2" condition showing relatively more counts than the "P1_20240627_B1" condition at most intensities, except for near intensities of 0.

ISSUES: None

Cell 33
==========

OVERVIEW: This cell serves as a transition to the next step which focuses on analyzing the spatial distribution of intensities.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None
ISSUES: None

Cell 34
==========

OVERVIEW: This cell computes and plots the radial intensity profile for both images by calculating the average intensity as a function of distance from the center of the image. A function `radial_profile` is defined, leveraging numpy to calculate euclidean distances from the center and binning pixel intensities into different radii. The function handles cases where a ring contains no pixels by setting the intensity to zero. Radial profiles are calculated and plotted for both the A and B condition images to compare the distribution of intensities from the center of the image outwards.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: The image is a line plot of "Radial Intensity Profile from Center of Image". The x-axis is "Distance from Center (pixels)" ranging from 0 to 8000. The y-axis is "Average Intensity". Two lines are plotted, one for the first image (blue) and one for the second image (orange). Both lines show a generally decreasing average intensity with distance from the image center. The orange line (second image) has consistently higher average intensity values compared to the blue line(first image) throughout the plotted distances.
