    "OVERVIEW: This cell serves as a title for the Jupyter notebook, introducing the specific Dandiset (001276) that will be explored: \"NG-CANCAN Remote Targeting Electroporation.\"\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: None\n",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell provides a disclaimer, stating that the notebook was AI-generated and may not be fully verified. It advises readers/users to exercise caution when interpreting the code and results, setting expectations for potential inaccuracies.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: None\n",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell provides a brief description of the Dandiset 001276 being explored. It explains the experiment's focus which involved variations in burst numbers during NG-CANCAN Remote Targeting Electroporation and its effect on cell monolayer permeabilization.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: None",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell provides a direct link to the Dandiset 001276 on the Neurosift platform, allowing users to easily access and explore the dataset online.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: None",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell provides an outline of the notebook's content, listing the key steps that will be covered: loading metadata using the DANDI API, loading an NWB file, visualizing image data, and suggesting future analysis directions. This gives the user a clear expectation of what will follow.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: None",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell lists the Python packages required to execute the code in the notebook. This allows the user to confirm they have the necessary packages installed before running the notebook.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: None\n",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell introduces the section focused on loading the Dandiset.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: None\n",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell uses the `dandiapi` client to retrieve and display information about Dandiset 001276. Specifically, it retrieves the Dandiset, lists its assets (files), and prints the number of assets along with the paths of the first five assets.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: None",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell introduces the process of loading a specific NWB file (\"sub-P1-20240627-A2/sub-P1-20240627-A2_obj-1aoyzxh_image.nwb\") and examining its metadata. It provides code to construct the URL for downloading the asset using its asset ID.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: None\n",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell loads the NWB file from the URL specified in the previous cell, using `pynwb`, `h5py`, and `remfile`. It opens the file, reads it into an `nwb` object, and then accesses and displays several metadata attributes of the NWB file: `session_description`, `identifier`, `session_start_time`, `experimenter`, `lab`, and `institution`. However, the last attribute displayed is the only text that is returned, likely due to the other attributes being displayed before it in the console/notebook.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES:\n1.  The notebook prints a warning about conflicting namespace versions. While probably not critical, it would be good to determine its source and remedy the warning (e.g. with correct package installation instructions).\n2. Only the last attribute `nwb.institution` is displayed in the output. To show all of them, each needs to be printed explicitly using `print(nwb.session_description)`, `print(nwb.identifier)`, etc. Otherwise, only the last line's value is displayed in the output.",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell introduces the section focused on loading and visualizing image data from the NWB file.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: None",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell loads and visualizes a subset of the image data acquired through SingleTimePointImaging stored in the NWB file. It extracts a 100x100 pixel section starting from coordinates (7000, 7000) of the first frame, scales the data to a 0-1 range, and displays it as a grayscale image with a colorbar.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: The output image is a grayscale representation of cells. The image has varying shades of gray representing different intensity levels, with brighter regions likely corresponding to cells and darker regions to the background. A colorbar is present to the right of the image indicating the mapping of intensity values to grayscale levels from 0 to 1.\n\nISSUES: None",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell summarizes the notebook's accomplishments (loading and visualizing data from Dandiset 001276) and suggests potential next steps for analysis, such as cell segmentation, fluorescence intensity quantification, and comparison of electroporation protocols.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: None"
