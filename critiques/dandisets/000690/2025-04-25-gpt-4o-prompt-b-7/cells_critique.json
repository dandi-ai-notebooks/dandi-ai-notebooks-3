    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the Dandiset (000690) being explored in the notebook. It provides a brief description of the Dandiset's focus (neural representations in the mouse brain) and a link to the Dandiset on the DANDI Archive. It then offers a concise notebook summary, outlining the key analysis steps: loading data and exploring corneal reflection and running wheel data. Finally, it specifies the necessary Python packages.\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell uses the `dandi` library to connect to the DANDI archive and retrieve information about Dandiset 000690. It fetches and prints the Dandiset's name and URL. It then lists all the assets within the Dandiset, displaying the paths of the first five assets. Finally, it provides the URL of a specific NWB file for further exploration and a link to visualize the corresponding data on Neurosift.\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell serves as a heading, indicating that the subsequent cells will focus on visualizing eye-tracking data from the Dandiset.\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell loads eye-tracking data from the specified NWB file using `h5py` and `remfile`. It accesses the timestamps and spatial data, takes a sample of the first 1000 data points, and generates a plot showing the X and Y coordinates of the eye position over time. The plot includes appropriately labeled axes, a title (\"Eye Tracking - Position over Time\"), and a legend to distinguish between the X and Y coordinate traces. Finally, it closes the HDF5 file.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe image is a line plot showing eye-tracking data over time. The x-axis represents \"Time (seconds)\", ranging from approximately 15 to 31. The y-axis represents \"Position (meters)\", ranging from 225 to 375. There are two lines plotted: one blue, labeled \"X coordinate,\" and one orange, labeled \"Y coordinate\". The X coordinate shows fluctuations mostly between 350 and 375, then decreases to around 350 after t=24 seconds, then again to arond 345 around t=28 seconds. The Y coordinate is more stable ranging between 240 and 270 throughout the period shown. There are some marked drops in these coordinates, where both coordinates appear to drop off at the same time.\n\nISSUES:\nThe y axis label (\"Position (meters)\") is potentially misleading. Eye tracking spatial series are typically in arbitrary units such as pixels, and are very unlikely to be recorded in meters. This is a critical issue.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell serves as a heading, indicating that the subsequent cells will focus on visualizing running wheel data.\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell loads running wheel data from the same NWB file used in the previous cell. It accesses the timestamps and rotation data, takes a sample of the first 1000 data points, and generates a plot showing the wheel's rotation (in radians) over time. The plot is labeled with appropriate axis titles, a title (\"Running Wheel Rotation over Time\"), and a legend for the \"Wheel Rotation\" trace. Finally the HDF5 file is closed.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe image is a line plot visualizing running wheel rotation over time. The x-axis represents \"Time (seconds)\", ranging from approximately 112.5 to 130. The y-axis represents \"Rotation (radians)\", ranging from -1 to 2.5. A single blue line represents the \"Wheel Rotation\". The line shows the wheel rotation varying over time with some periods of no movement, then a few large positive and negative swings indicating forward and backward rotations of the wheel.\n\nISSUES:\nThe code reloads the NWB file, even though it was already loaded and could have been re-used from the last cell. This isn't a huge issue, but is not efficient. The code also closes the HDF5 file opened by h5py, which is good practice. Also, there is no AI warning on this cell even though the intoductory cell warned that all cells were AI generated. This is a surprising inconsistency.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell provides a brief summary of the notebook, highlighting the visualizations of eye-tracking and running wheel data. It also suggests potential future directions for analysis, including exploration of spike sorting data, analysis of neural responses to visual stimuli, and integration of multiple sessions.\n\nISSUES:\nNone"
