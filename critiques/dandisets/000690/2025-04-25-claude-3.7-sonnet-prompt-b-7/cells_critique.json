    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell explores eye-tracking data if it exists within the NWB file. First, it checks for the 'EyeTracking' field in `nwb.acquisition`. If present, it prints the available components of the eye tracking data. If 'pupil_tracking' and 'area' data are available, the cell plots pupil area over time, and calculates and displays stats such as the baseline pupil area (25th percentile), the number of dilation events (instances where area > 1.5x baseline), and the percentage of time the pupil is dilated. Next, the cell checks for and plots blink data, showing instances of blinks over time. It also calculates and displays the blink rate.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\n- **Pupil Area Plot:** This plot shows pupil area over time (sampled to a maximum of 10,000 points). The x-axis represents time in seconds, and the y-axis represents pupil area. The plot includes a horizontal dashed red line indicating the baseline pupil area. The plot also includes a text box displaying the baseline value, the number of dilation events (where pupil area exceeds baseline by a factor of 1.5), and the percentage of time the pupil is dilated.

    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell focuses on the neural data stored in probe-specific NWB files. First, it closes the previously opened \"main\" NWB file to free up resources. It then searches for a probe-specific NWB file corresponding to the same subject. If found, it prints the path and generates a Neurosift link. The file is loaded, its session ID is printed, and electrode group information (name, description, location, device description, and sampling rate) is displayed. The code then checks for LFP data, plots LFP traces of a short sample period for the first 10 channels, and extracts /visualizes unit (putative neuron) firing rate distributions, along with metrics such as signal-to-noise ratio, ISI violations, presence ratio, and amplitude. Finally, it closes the probe file.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\n- **LFP Traces Plot:** This plot displays local field potential (LFP) traces for channels 0-9 during a sampled period. The plot is a grid of 10 subplots, one for each channel. Each subplot shows the LFP signal over time, with the x-axis representing time (in seconds) and the y-axis representing the LFP signal.\n- **Firing Rates Distribution Plot:** This plot shows the distribution of firing rates for the neural units. The x-axis is firing rate in Hz, and the y-axis is the count. A red dashed line indicates the mean firing rate, while a green dotted line indicates the median firing rate. A legend clarifies which line is the mean and median.\n- **Quality Metrics Distribution Plots:** These plots (up to 4) display distributions of signal quality metrics of all putative neurons. Example metrics are signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), ISI violations, presence ratio, and amplitude.\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the analysis of the relationship between running speed and neural activity. It sets the context for investigating how locomotion relates to neural processing.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell creates simulated data to illustrate the potential relationship between running speed and neural activity. The script generates simulated running speed data with periods of activity using ramped starts and stops and then simulates neural activity for three types of neurons: a V1 neuron with increased activity during running; a hippocampal neuron with a complex adaptation effect; and a higher visual area neuron with a delayed response to running. Finally, the script plots the running speed and the firing rates of these simulated neurons against time.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe figure has 4 subplots.\n- The first subplot shows the simulated running speed over time. The y-axis is \"Speed (cm/s)\". The periods of activity (\"running_episodes\") are visible.\n- The second subplot shows the simulated firing rate of a V1 neuron, which increases during simulated running. The y-axis is \"Firing Rate (Hz)\".\n- The third subplot shows the simulated firing rate of visual neuron from a higher area (compared V1), which has a delayed response, of around 1.5 sec, to the simulated running. The y-axis is \"Firing Rate (Hz)\".\n- The fourth subplot showws the simulated firing rate of a hippocampal neuron, showing adaptation to long periods of sustained running. The y-axis is \"Firing Rate (Hz)\".\n\nISSUES:\nNone",

    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell creates a simulated receptive field mapping based on neural responses to moving bars. The script generates visual space grid, and then creates receptive fields for different neuron types: V1 simple cell (creates oriented Gabor filter and another horizontal one, V1simple2_rf), higher visual area (larger and more complex, Higher_rf), and Hippocampal area (less spatially specific). Then it visualizes each of these simulated receptive fields in a subplot.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThis figure includes 4 subplots of the simulated receptive fields.\n- The first subplot (\"V1 Simple Cell Oriented RF\") visualizes a Gabor filter with a title, azimuth and elevation axis labels, and a response colorbar labeled \"Response\".\n- The second subplot (\"V1 Simple Cell Horizontal RF\") visualizes a Gabor filter tilted horizontally. The axis and colorbar are the same as in the first subplot.\n- The third subplot (\"Higher Visual Area Complex RF\") visualizes a complex cell-like RF. The axis and colorbar are the same as in the first subplot.\n- The fourth subplot (\"Hippocampal Cell Spatial Preference\") visualizes a less spatially specific radial gradient. It is titled \"Hippocampal Cell Spatial Preference,\" has azimuth and elevation axis labels, and a response colorbar labeled \"Response.\"\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the simulated neural responses to different stimulus types, setting up the scenario for illustrating how neural responses might evolve from simple feature detectors in early visual areas to more abstract representations in the hippocampus.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell generates simulated neural responses to different stimuli for different neuron types to illustrate how neural responses might evolve from simple feature detectors in early visual areas to more abstract representations in the hippocampus. The code defines four different stimulus types (`SAC_standard`, `SAC_wide`, `SAC_reverse`, `Natural_movie`) and their presentation periods. It then simulates the responses of three neuron types ('V1 Cell', 'Higher Visual Cell', 'Hippocampal Cell') to these stimuli. Each neuron type has different response weights for each stimulus and different temporal dynamics (e.g., fast onset, slow onset, adaptation). Finally, it visualizes the neural responses to different stimuli on the three types of neurons.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe figure displays one subplot describing the stimulus timing for the four different conditions and three subplots, each representing one of the three neuron (brain area) types in the simulation: V1 Cell, Higher Visual Cell, and Hippocampal Cell. Each neural response subplot shows a distinct firing rate for that neuron's response to each of the stimuli, with clear differences depending on the neuron type. Vertical colored spans of different transparency highlight stimulus presentation: blue for SAC_standard, green for SAC_wide, red for SAC_reverse and purple for Natural_movie.\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
