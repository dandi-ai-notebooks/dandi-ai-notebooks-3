    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell provides an introduction to the notebook, outlining its purpose and scope. It introduces the specific Dandiset (000690) being explored, gives a brief description of the underlying research project, and provides a link to the Dandiset on the DANDI Archive. The cell also states a disclaimer about the AI-generated nature of the notebook and lists the high-level steps the notebook will cover.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell lists the Python packages required to run the code in the notebook. This is helpful for the user to ensure they have the necessary dependencies installed.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell imports the necessary Python libraries (dandi, pynwb, h5py, remfile, seaborn, matplotlib, and pandas). Then, it connects to the DANDI archive using the `DandiAPIClient` and retrieves the specified Dandiset (000690). The code prints the Dandiset name and URL from the metadata. Finally, it lists the first 5 assets (files) present in the Dandiset.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell specifies the NWB file that will be explored in the following cells: `sub-692072/sub-692072_ses-1298465622.nwb`. It mentions that the subsequent cells will demonstrate how to access the structural data within the file. It also provides a link to view the file on Neurosift.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell loads the NWB file specified in the previous cell from a URL using `remfile` and `h5py`. It then uses `pynwb` to read the HDF5 file into an `nwb` object. Finally, it prints the session description, session ID, and session start time from the NWB file, demonstrating access to the metadata within the file.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nThe many UserWarning messages from hdmf are not critical but may be distracting. It would be good to suppress these warnings if possible, or at least acknowledge them in the markdown.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell serves as a transition to visualizing data from the loaded NWB file, specifically eye-tracking information.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell retrieves eye-tracking data (specifically corneal reflection tracking) from the NWB file loaded in the previous steps. It loads the first 1000 data points for visualization. A line plot is generated, displaying the X and Y positions of the corneal reflection over the sample index. The plot is labeled with a title, axis labels, and a legend.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe generated plot shows two lines representing the X and Y positions of corneal reflection over 1000 sample indices. The X axis is labeled \"Sample Index,\" and the Y axis is labeled \"Position (meters).\" The blue line represents the X position, and the orange line represents the Y position. Both lines show variations in position, but the X position appears to fluctuate more than the Y position.\n\nISSUES:\nThe y-axis is labeled \"Position (meters)\", but the actual units in NWB files are often unspecified. The notebook should verify the units are meters, and if not, label the plot appropriately, or potentially convert the units. There's also no information about the sampling rate, which is crucial for interpreting the time scale represented by the sample index. Adding such information would greatly improve the plot's informativeness.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell summarizes the notebook's accomplishments: demonstrating how to load and visualize data from a Dandiset using the DANDI API and PyNWB. It also suggests future directions for analysis, such as exploring behavioral correlations or performing spike sorting, and notes that these analyses may require more advanced computing tools.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n"
