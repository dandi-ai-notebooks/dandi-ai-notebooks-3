It extracts the LFP data itself, prints its shape, the number of channels, the number of time points, unit and sampling interval. It then examines the first and last three timestamps and calculates the recording duration. This provides a comprehensive overview of the LFP data's structure and temporal extent.

    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell visualizes a subset of the LFP data. It selects a 5-second time window starting at 100 seconds and plots the LFP signals from every 10th channel (resulting in 9 channels). Each channel's signal is offset vertically for better visualization. The plot displays the LFP signal (with offset) against time, with labels, title, a grid, and a legend placed outside the plot area.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe generated plot displays time on the x-axis (ranging from 100 to 105 seconds) and LFP (in mV) plus an offset on the y-axis. There are 9 horizontal lines representing the LFP signals from channels 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, and 80. Each channel is offset vertically by 0.5 mV, so that the signals do not overlap, enabling the user to see all signals. The plot includes labels for the axes, a title \"LFP signals from 9 channels, 100-105 seconds\", a grid, and a legend located outside of the main plot area to the top right. The LFP signals appear almost flat within this short time window indicating little change in voltage over time.\n\nISSUES:\nThe plot shows almost flat lines for each channel. This could indicate a problem with the data, the selected time window not being representative of the LFP activity, or a scaling issue. Given that it's LFP data, some more variation would be expected. This could be a result of the AI generation missing some scaling issues. The y-axis label should explicitly state the units for offset (mV), not just LFP. Need to add that \"0.5 mV\" is the offset.",

    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell creates a scatter plot to visualize the electrode positions on the probe. The horizontal and vertical positions from the `electrode_df` are used as x and y coordinates. The color of each point represents whether the electrode has valid data (1 for Yes, 0 for No), using the 'viridis' colormap, however since all electrodes have valid data, all the points have the same color. The plot includes a colorbar, axis labels (with units in \u03bcm), a title, and a grid. This provides a visual representation of the probe's geometry and electrode arrangement.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe generated scatter plot visualizes the positions of the electrodes on probe 0. The x-axis represents the horizontal position in micrometers, ranging from approximately 56 to 62. The y-axis represents the vertical position in micrometers, ranging from 0 to 3500. The electrodes are arranged in a single vertical line at a horizontal position of approximately 59 \u03bcm. All points have the same teal color, indicating that all the electrodes contain valid data. A colorbar on the right indicates the mapping from color to valid data status (1=Yes, 0=No). The plot has a title \"Electrode Positions on Probe 0\" and a grid.\n\nISSUES:\nNone. All electrodes have valid data and that information is shown in the colorbar.",

It then prints the distribution and visualizes it using a bar plot. The plot shows the number of electrodes for each brain region, with labels and a title.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe bar plot displays the distribution of electrodes across different brain regions. The brain regions are listed on the x-axis (CA1, none, CA3, VISl5, DG, VISl6, VISl2/3, VISl4, VISl1), and the number of electrodes in each region is represented on the y-axis. The height of each bar corresponds to the number of electrodes in that region. CA1 has the most electrodes (33), followed by 'none' (14), CA3 (9), VISl5 (7), DG (7), VISl6 (4), VISl2/3 (4), VISl4 (3), and VISl1 (3).

It selects one stimulus type (\"SAC_Wd15_Vel2_Bndry1_Cntst0_loop_presentations\"), extracts the corresponding presentation intervals, converts them to a Pandas DataFrame, and displays the column names and the first 5 presentations (containing start time, stop time, stimulus\\_name, orientation, and contrast). This provides a structured overview of the stimulus presentation data.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the concept of aligning LFP data with visual stimuli to investigate potential neural responses.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell selects a single stimulus presentation (index 100) and extracts the LFP data around that presentation (1 second before and 2 seconds after). It then extracts the channels for brain region CA3, plots this data, and draws vertical lines to mark the stimulus onset and offset.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe plot shows LFP responses to a stimulus presentation with time relative to stimulus onset (in seconds) on the x-axis, ranging from -1 to 2. The y-axis represents LFP in mV plus an offset. The LFP data from 9 channels in the CA3 region (Ch 2, Ch 6, Ch 10, Ch 14, Ch 18, Ch 22, Ch 26, Ch 30, Ch 34) are overlaid, each offset vertically for better visibility. The vertical red dashed line indicates the stimulus onset at time 0, and the green dashed line indicates the stimulus offset, which is very close to the stimulus onset due to the stimulus duration being only 0.02 seconds. The plot title describes the data as 'LFP responses to stimulus presentation (Region: CA3)'. Again, the LFP signals appear flat.\n\nISSUES:\nThe LFP signals are essentially flat. Given that it is a real stimulus, there is expected to be more signal. Also, the duration of the presentation is extremely short (0.02 seconds), so this might not capture anything salient. Additionally, there are only 9 channels plotted. It should say in the description \"9 channels were chosen\" in the plot.\n\nThe number of channels is not consistent. In this code the number of channels is set to 9 because electrode\\_df has 9 electrodes for CA3 brain region. But the comment said \"from a particular brain region\" so the code could have chosen a subset of channels. The comment indicates something different from code which is confusing.\n\nSame as before, the y-axis label should explicitly state the units for offset (mV), not just LFP. Need to add that \"0.3 mV\" is the offset.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the spectral analysis of LFP data. It suggests that the subsequent code will explore the oscillatory activity within the data and how it might be influenced by sensory stimuli.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell computes and visualizes the spectrogram of the LFP signal from a single channel in the CA3 region. It calculates the sampling frequency, computes the spectrogram using `scipy.signal.spectrogram`, displays the spectrogram as a pcolormesh plot, and adds vertical lines for stimulus onset and offset. The spectrogram shows the power spectral density of the LFP signal as a function of time and frequency.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe plot is a spectrogram of the LFP signal from channel 2 in the CA3 region. The x-axis represents time relative to stimulus onset (in seconds), ranging from approximately -0.8 to 1.8. The y-axis represents frequency in Hz, ranging from 0 to 100. The color of each point in the spectrogram represents the power/frequency in dB/Hz, with the color scale on the right ranging from -160 (dark blue) to -90 (yellow). The red dashed vertical line marks the stimulus onset, and the green dashed line marks the stimulus offset. There is a range of activity across all frequencies.\n\nISSUES:\nThe stimulus duration is tiny making it very hard to interpret its effects. The spectrogram seems to be showing something, but there are no obvious changes in spectral power correlated with stimulus onset/offset. The legend overlaps with the plot area (solution might be to do bbox\\_to\\_anchor).",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the idea of comparing LFP responses across different stimulus types by analyzing the power in specific frequency bands. It suggests that different stimuli might elicit distinct neural responses that can be revealed through this analysis.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell aims to compare LFP power in different frequency bands across stimulus types. It defines a function `compute_band_power` to calculate the average power within a specified frequency range using Welch's method. Several frequency bands (theta, alpha, beta, gamma) and stimulus types (standard bar, wider bar, faster bar) are selected. It then samples presentations the different stimulus types. For each stimulus presentation, the code computes the power in each frequency band and stores the results in a Pandas DataFrame. Finally, it uses seaborn to plot a boxplot comparing the power in different frequency bands across different stimulus types.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe boxplot compares the LFP power in different frequency bands (theta, alpha, beta, and gamma) across three stimulus types: \"SAC\\_Wd15\\_Vel2\\_Bndry1\\_Cntst0\\_loop\", \"SAC\\_Wd45\\_Vel2\\_Bndry1\\_Cntst0\\_loop\", and \"SAC\\_Wd15\\_Vel8\\_Bndry1\\_Cntst0\\_loop\". The x-axis represents the frequency band, and the y-axis represents the power on a logarithmic scale. The plot displays the distribution of LFP power for each stimulus type within each frequency band using boxplots. Notice that bands theta, alpha, and beta have no data. Only Gamma has power data. The boxes are color-coded to distinguish between stimulus types.\n\nISSUES:\n- The stimulus duration is very short (0.02 seconds). This means that the time window `stim_data` to compute band-power is way too short. This should have been caught earlier in the notebook.\n- Because of the short duration there is a warning: \"UserWarning: nperseg = 2500 is greater than input length = 20, using nperseg = 20\". This is because there isn't enough LFP data.\n- As a consequence of this, the vast majority of the data is missing. Almost all the boxplots are empty. Only, the gamma frequency has some values.\n- There appears to be a mismatch between selected_region and the valid electrodes, so code should also have selected the channel based on availability of the brain region.\n- The current spectral analysis should be corrected: the duration of the data should match/be substantially larger than the window used for PSD estimate. The time window needs to be several seconds not milliseconds.\n- Stimulus types are not described (only with their names). It is hard to understand the plots without knowing what these stimulus types mean.\n\nThese issues could have been easily caught running the notebook. It is a major failure for the AI to generate a broken notebook.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the possibility of exploring the sorted spike data (\"units\") present in the main session file and analyzing spiking activity in relation to the visual stimuli.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell accesses and explores the \"units\" data (sorted spike data) within the main session NWB file. It prints the number of units, converts the units data into a Pandas DataFrame, lists the available columns in the DataFrame, and then displays descriptive statistics for the 'firing\\_rate', 'snr', 'quality', 'presence\\_ratio', and 'isi\\_violations' columns. This provides an initial overview of the spiking activity data and its quality metrics.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the analysis of the spiking behavior of high-quality units around the time of stimulus presentations, suggesting that the following code will select such neurons and examine their activity patterns.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell filters the units DataFrame to select high-quality units based on 'quality', 'snr', and 'isi\\_violations' criteria. It then selects the first 5 of these high-quality units for analysis. A function `create_raster_plot` is defined to generate a raster plot showing the spike times of multiple units around a given stimulus presentation. The function retrieves spike times for each unit, filters the spikes to include only those within a specified time window, normalizes the spike times to the stimulus onset, and plots the spikes as vertical lines. The stimulus onset and offset times are also indicated on the plot. Finally, the code calls the `create_raster_plot` function to generate a raster plot for a specific stimulus type and presentation index, visualizing the spiking activity of the selected high-quality units.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe image is a raster plot of spike times for 5 selected high-quality units around the presentation of the \"SAC\\_Wd15\\_Vel2\\_Bndry1\\_Cntst0\\_loop\" stimulus. The x-axis represents time relative to stimulus onset (in seconds), ranging from -1 to 2. The y-axis represents each high-quality unit (Unit 44, Unit 32, Unit 30, Unit 28 and Unit 18) with the vertical ticks representing individual spike times. The red dashed vertical line indicates the stimulus onset at time 0, and the green dashed vertical line indicates the stimulus offset, which occurs very close to the red onset line due to the stimulus duration of 0.02 seconds.\n\nISSUES:\n- Need to revisit what duration makes sense. The duration of the stimulus presentation (0.02 seconds) is far too short again. The raster plots show very little activity around the stimulus, and this is expected, so any stimulus-related activity cannot be captured.\n- The spike amplitudes are not used, so the amplitude for spikes around visual stimulus cannot be seen. This may be useful.\n- Given only a single presentation its difficult/impossible to draw conclusions. It should have sampled more presentations.\n- No explanation of what \"high quality units mean. If the qualities were good, the firing rates should have been larger.\n\nAgain, problems introduced as a result of the automatically generated code not catching the too short duration. This needs to be checked and debugged.",

    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell explores eye-tracking data contained in the NWB file. It first checks for the existence of the 'EyeTracking' acquisition and then lists the available data types. It then accesses the pupil tracking data, including pupil position, timestamps, and pupil area. The shape of the data arrays and the time range of the recording are also printed. Finally, it generates two plots, plotting pupil area over time and pupil position (x and y coordinates) colored by time.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe first plot displays pupil area over time. The x-axis represents time in seconds, ranging from approximately 175 to 350. The y-axis represents the pupil area with values from somewhere around 4000 to 14000, with some outliers going to 40,000. The plot shows the pupil area fluctuating over time, with a clear periodic structure. The title of the graph is Pupil Area Over Time.\nThe second plot displays pupil position. The x-axis represents the X position and the y-axis represents the Y position, and the points are color-coded by time (in seconds), from just above 200 to just below 350, according to the scale bar on the right. The plot shows the pupil position clustered in a central region, with drifts and variations in position. A color bar shows the correspondence between color and time. The plot has a title \"Pupil Position\".\n\nISSUES:\nPupil area can't be NaN. Need to fix those NaN. However, there is a NaN in the time range (Time range: 14.68052 - nan seconds). The code needs to check/remove timestamps where there are NaN.\n\nThe data contains values that seem unphysiological. The pupile area goes up to 40000 while the non outlier range goes up to 14000. This needs to be checked. Outlier data may skew the data.",

This is the culminating analysis of the notebook where the different datatypes are investigated against each other to help discover trends in the data.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell correlates eye movement data with LFP activity around the presentation of a specific stimulus. It begins by selecting a stimulus presentation and then extracts the corresponding eye-tracking data (pupil area and position) and LFP data within a time window around the stimulus. The cell then generates a figure with three subplots, displaying the the pupil area and position along with the LFP data. Vertical lines are added to indicate the stimulus onset and offset times.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe figure displays three subplots, all sharing the same x-axis: time relative to stimulus onset (s), ranging from about -1 to 1.\n- The first subplot shows LFP (mV) fluctuation over time around the stimulus presentation onset, marked in red. A green vertical line indicates the stimulus offset.\n- The second subplot shows variation of the pupil area over time around the stimulus presentation.\n- The third subplot shows the X and Y positions of the pupil over time. The stimulus lines are displayed for reference on all subplots.\n\nISSUES:\n- Need to revisit the stimulus parameter. The short stimulus duration (0.02 seconds) means they are not capturing differences related to the stimulus.\n- No attempt to quantify correlation (for example, cross-correlation), just a qualitative comparison of the plots, so the analysis is incomplete.\n- The LFP data has its own timestamps that are different from the pupil_tracking, so an interpolation may help align the LFP and eye tracking before plotting.\n\nImportant note: because many of the previous sections are broken (stimulus duration, spectral power, etc) the most important goal of the notebook (correlation) has been jeopardized.\n\nThis notebook has some serious issues that should have been caught. The AI-generated code disclaimer has proven to be prescient.",

    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell explores the relationship between running speed and neural activity. It first checks for the presence of running speed data and accesses it, including the running speed values and timestamps. It visualizes running speed over time using a line plot. It then computes the average running speed, the LFP power in different frequency bands, and correlates the running speed and LFP power by performing a scatterplot with different bands.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\n- The first plot displays the running speed of the mouse over time. The x-axis represents time in seconds (from 300 to 650), and the y-axis represents the running speed in cm/s from -10 to 50. This plot shows a highly fluctuating trace of running speed.\n- The next four plots are scatter plots. The x axis displays running speed in cm/s from -2 to 14. The y axis displays theta, alpha, beta, and gamma power in different unlabelled units. Each graph displays a red line showing a linear regression. The graphs show the weak relationships among running speed vs neural signals.\ntheta, alpha, beta, and gamma are different plots and the trends are different across different neural bands.\n\nISSUES:\n- There is a risk of circularity by trying to correlate average speed using a window size = 1.0 and step size = 0.5 with very short stimulus windows = 0.02.\n- There is a user warning caused because the nperseg is larger than the window that should be investigated.\n- There is a weak relationship between running speed and neural signals, so may need to check more signals.\n- No quantification - can add correlation coefficient\n- This would be better/clearer as a matrix heatmap rather than separate scatter plots\n\nIt still has many of the broken modules like stimulus windows and neural signal analysis. This section isn't great and doesn't have very convincing results.",
