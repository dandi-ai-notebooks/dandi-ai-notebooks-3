    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell contains the title of the Jupyter notebook. It introduces the Dandiset being explored: 000690, also specifying that the data comes from the Allen Institute Openscope - Vision2Hippocampus project.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell is a disclaimer, warning the user that the notebook content was AI-generated and may contain errors. This is important for setting expectations and encouraging critical evaluation of the notebook's contents.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell provides a brief introduction to the notebook's purpose: exploring Dandiset 000690, specifically highlighting LFP data and electrode metadata from the Allen Institute Openscope - Vision2Hippocampus project. It also includes a direct link to the Dandiset on the DANDI Archive.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell outlines the structure and content of the notebook. It lists the main steps demonstrating how to load the Dandiset, explore its contents, visualize LFP data, and examine electrode metadata. This helps the user understand the notebook's flow.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell lists the Python packages required to run the code in the notebook. This is helpful for users to ensure they have the necessary dependencies installed before running the notebook.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell connects to the DANDI archive using the `DandiAPIClient`, retrieves Dandiset 000690, and prints basic Dandiset metadata (name and URL).  It then lists the first five assets from the Dandiset, displaying their paths. This allows the user to see what files are contained within the Dandiset.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell prepares the user to load and explore an NWB file from the Dandiset. It specifies which NWB file will be loaded: `sub-692072/sub-692072_ses-1298465622_probe-1_ecephys.nwb`. It also provides a link to view the same file on NeuroSift.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell loads the NWB file specified in the previous cell using `remfile` and `pynwb`. It retrieves the NWB file from the provided URL and reads it into an `nwb` object. Then, it accesses and displays several metadata attributes of the NWB file, including session description, identifier, start time, file creation date, and subject information (age, genotype, sex, and species). The `UserWarning` messages are related to HDMF namespace versions and are likely inconsequential in this case. The final output, \"Mus musculus\", is the species.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nThe notebook prints the final attribute `nwb.subject.species` as the final output. While this is correct, it might be better practice to print all the attributes accessed using a single print statement at the end for clarity. Also, while inconsequential, it might be good to suppress the warning messages related to HDMF namespace.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell serves as a header, indicating that the following code will load and visualize local field potential (LFP) data from the previously loaded NWB file.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell loads and visualizes a segment of LFP data from the NWB file. It accesses the LFP data and timestamps, converts the data to microvolts, and generates a plot of the LFP data over time.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe plot shows LFP data from probe 1 over time. The x-axis represents time in seconds, ranging from approximately 20.5 to 21.3 seconds. The y-axis represents the LFP signal in microvolts, ranging from approximately -300 to 200 \u03bcV. There are 10 lines plotted, each representing the LFP signal from a different channel or electrode. They fluctuate over time, displaying the typical noisy characteristics of LFP data. The plot has a title \"LFP Data from probe 1\", and labels for both axes. The seaborn theme is applied, resulting in a plot with a grey background and a grid.\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell serves as a header to indicate that the following code will examine the electrode metadata associated with the LFP data.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell retrieves electrode metadata from the NWB file, converts it into a Pandas DataFrame, and displays the first few rows and descriptive statistics of the DataFrame. This allows the user to inspect the available electrode metadata, for instance, spatial location and probe information. The final line of output indicates that the 'imp' column contains NaN values.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe first display is a table showing the first 5 rows of the `electrodes_df` DataFrame.  The columns include 'location', 'group', 'group_name', 'probe_vertical_position', 'probe_horizontal_position', 'probe_id', 'local_index', 'valid_data', 'x', 'y', 'z', 'imp', and 'filtering'. The 'imp' column is filled with NaN values.\n\nThe second display is a table showing descriptive statistics (count, mean, std, min, 25%, 50%, 75%, max) for the numerical columns in the `electrodes_df` DataFrame: 'probe_vertical_position', 'probe_horizontal_position', 'probe_id', 'local_index', 'x', 'y', 'z', and 'imp'. The 'imp' column shows count as 0.0 and all other values are NaN.\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell provides a brief summary of what was covered in the notebook. It reiterates that the notebook covered Dandiset 000690, highlighting the exploration of LFP data and electrode metadata.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell suggests potential directions for further exploration and analysis of the Dandiset, including exploring other NWB files, performing more in-depth analysis of LFP data, and investigating the relationship between LFP data and electrode metadata. This encourages the user to continue exploring the data.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone"
