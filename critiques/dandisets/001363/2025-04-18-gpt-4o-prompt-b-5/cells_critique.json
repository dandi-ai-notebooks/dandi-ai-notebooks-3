    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell provides an introduction to the notebook and the Dandiset it explores (dandiset 001363). It includes the title and description of the Dandiset, a link to Neurosift, and a brief outline of what the notebook will cover: loading the Dandiset, accessing and analyzing data in NWB files, and visualizing data. It also includes a disclaimer about the AI-generated nature of the notebook.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell lists the Python packages required to run the notebook.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the next section of the notebook, which will cover loading the Dandiset from the DANDI archive.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell uses the DandiAPIClient to connect to the DANDI archive and retrieve the dandiset with ID \"001363\". It then lists the first 5 assets (NWB files) in the Dandiset, showing their paths.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the next section, which will explore the content of one of the NWB files within the Dandiset.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell loads a specific NWB file from the DANDI archive using its URL, leveraging `remfile` to handle remote access and `h5py` to read the HDF5 file format. It then prints the session description, session start time, and identifier from the NWB file, providing a glimpse into the experiment's metadata.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\n1. The UserWarning messages from `hdmf.spec.namespace` are noisy but likely not critical, just indicating version conflicts in cached namespaces. It would be good practice to suppress these warnings to improve output clarity.\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the next step: visualizing a subset of the electrical data stored within the NWB file.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell accesses the 'ElectricalSeries' data from the loaded NWB file, extracts the first 2000 samples from the first electrode, and plots this data. The plot displays voltage over sample index, with appropriate labels and a grid. The cell also closes the file connections (NWBHDF5IO, h5py file, and remfile).\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe plot shows a time-series of voltage fluctuations for the first 2000 samples recorded from the first electrode. The x-axis is labeled \"Sample Index\" ranging from 0 to 2000, and the y-axis is labeled \"Voltage (V)\". The voltage values appear to fluctuate randomly around zero, with a range of approximately -2e-5 to 2e-5 volts. The title is \"Voltage Signal of First Electrode: First 2000 Samples\". A grid is present, enhancing readability.\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell provides a summary of the notebook and suggests future directions for analysis.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone"
