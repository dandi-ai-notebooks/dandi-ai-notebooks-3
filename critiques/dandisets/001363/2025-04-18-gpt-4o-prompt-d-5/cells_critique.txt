Cell 1
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell introduces the notebook and its purpose: to explore Dandiset 001363, which contains neural spiking data from a rat somatosensory cortex, acquired using transcranial focused ultrasound. It mentions that the notebook was AI-generated and may contain errors, thereby setting a cautious tone for the reader. It provides a link to the Dandiset on NeuroSift and outlines the key analysis steps to be performed. Finally, it lists the Python packages required for running the notebook.

ISSUES:
None


Cell 2
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell serves as a heading for the next section of the notebook, which focuses on connecting to the DANDI Archive and loading the specified Dandiset. It prepares the reader for the code that will perform these actions.

ISSUES:
None


Cell 3
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell uses the `dandi` library to connect to the DANDI Archive and retrieve the specified Dandiset (001363). It then lists the first five assets (NWB files) found within the Dandiset. This provides an initial confirmation that the connection was successful and the Dandiset was accessed correctly. The initial listing of assets allows the user to see the naming convention and structure of the data.

ISSUES:
None


Cell 4
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell is a heading that introduces the next section of the notebook, which will focus on loading and exploring an NWB (Neurodata Without Borders) file from the Dandiset. It prepares the user for the code that will perform this task.

ISSUES:
None

Cell 5
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell loads a specific NWB file from the DANDI Archive using its URL. It uses `remfile` to handle remote file access, `h5py` to interact with the HDF5 file format, and `pynwb` to read the NWB file. The URL corresponds to the asset ID '59d1acbb-5ad5-45f1-b211-c2e311801824'. It then prints the session description, identifier, and session start time from the NWB file's metadata to provide the user with basic information about the recording. Some warnings about namespace versions are printed, but these don't appear to be critical and could likely be ignored.

ISSUES:
None

Cell 6
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell introduces a subsection on visualizing electrical series data, preparing the reader for the plotting code which will follow.

ISSUES:
None

Cell 7
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell accesses the ElectricalSeries data from the loaded NWB file. It extracts a segment of 1000 samples from the first channel (channel 0) and plots it. The plot shows the voltage values over time (sample index). After plotting, the NWB file handles are closed to free up resources.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image shows a plot of electrical series data for channel 0. The x-axis represents the "Sample Index" ranging from 0 to 1000. The y-axis represents the "Voltage (V)" with a scale of 1e-5, ranging roughly from -2.0 to 2.0. The plot displays a noisy, fluctuating signal, typical of raw neural recordings. The title of the plot is "Electrical Series Data Segment: Channel 0."

ISSUES:
None

Cell 8
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell provides a brief conclusion to the notebook and suggests directions for future research. It summarizes what has been accomplished (loading and visualizing data) and points toward more in-depth analysis, such as exploring different stimulation parameters or analyzing larger datasets, as potential next steps.

ISSUES:
None
