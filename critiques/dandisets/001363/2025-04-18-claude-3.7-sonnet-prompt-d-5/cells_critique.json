    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell provides an introduction to the Dandiset (001363) that the notebook will explore, summarizing its content, the experimental design (tFUS stimulation of the rat somatosensory cortex), and the variables manipulated. It also outlines the notebook's goals: loading metadata, examining electrode/trial structure, visualizing raw data and spectral properties, and comparing results across subjects. Further, it lists the required Python packages. The cell serves as a high-level overview and sets the stage for the subsequent analysis.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThere are no images in this cell.\n\nISSUES:\nNone.\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the next section of the notebook, which will focus on accessing NWB files from the specified Dandiset. It acts as a heading and provides context for the following cells.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThere are no images in this cell.\n\nISSUES:\nNone.\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell imports necessary Python libraries (pynwb, h5py, remfile, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scipy, seaborn) and defines the URLs and file paths for two NWB files from Dandiset 001363, one for subject BH589 and one for subject BH625. It prints the Dandiset name and the selected file information to the console. The `sns.set_theme()` line sets the plotting style using Seaborn.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThere are no images in this cell.\n\nISSUES:\nNone.",

    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell defines a function `load_nwb_file` to load an NWB file from a remote URL using `remfile`, `h5py`, and `pynwb`. It then calls this function with the `asset_url` defined in the previous cell to load the NWB file for subject BH589. The cell also prints a message indicating that the file is being loaded. The returned objects (nwb, io, h5_file, remote_file) will be available for further analysis. The UserWarning messages in the output are related to version conflicts in the hdmf namespace which is probably not severe, but should be noted.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThere are no images in this cell.\n\nISSUES:\nNone.

    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell examines the trial structure by accessing the trial data from the NWB file. It prints the number of trials and column names and displays the first 5 rows of the trials dataframe. It calculates and prints basic statistics about the trials, including the mean and standard deviation of trial durations and intervals. Two plots are then generated: a histogram showing the distribution of time intervals between trials, and a scatter plot displaying the start times of each trial as a function of trial number.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe first image is a histogram, labeled \"Distribution of Time Intervals Between Trials.\" The x-axis represents the interval in seconds (s), and the y-axis represents the count. The histogram displays the distribution of time intervals between consecutive trial starts. The intervals appear to cluster around 2.3 to 2.7 seconds, with varying frequencies.

This cell is a heading that clarifies the purpose of the following code.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThere are no images in this cell.\n\nISSUES:\nNone.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell selects the 10th trial, calculates the start and end indices based on the trial times and a buffer of 0.5 seconds, and then extracts the corresponding neural data for 5 selected electrodes (0, 8, 16, 24, and 31). It plots the neural activity (voltage over time) for each electrode in a separate subplot, with vertical dashed lines indicating the trial start and end times. Each subplot is titled with the electrode index and its group name, and the first subplot includes a legend. The plots provide a visual representation of the raw neural data during the trial.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe image contains five subplots, each displaying the neural activity (voltage over time) for a selected electrode. The x-axis represents \"Time (s)\" and the y-axis represents \"Voltage (V)\" for all subplots. Each subplot has a title indicating the electrode number and group name (e.g., \"Electrode 0 (shank1elec1)\"). The blue lines represent the recorded voltage fluctuations over time. Vertical dashed lines indicate the trial start (red) and end (green) times. The first subplot includes a legend for the trial start and end markers. The pattern of voltage fluctuation seems consistent across the electrodes.\n\nISSUES:\nNone.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the next section: spectral analysis of neural activity. The goal is to identify frequency-specific changes that might be induced by the ultrasound stimulation.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThere are no images in this cell.\n\nISSUES:\nNone.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell prepares data for spectral analysis by selecting a trial (number 10) and an electrode (number 16). It defines two 1-second time windows: one immediately before stimulation and one immediately after. It calculates the sample indices corresponding to these time windows and extracts the raw data from the electrical series for the chosen electrode and time periods. It then prints the start and end times of each window.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThere are no images in this cell.\n\nISSUES:\nNone.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell is a heading that introduces the calculation and comparison of Power Spectral Density (PSD) before and after stimulation.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThere are no images in this cell.\n\nISSUES:\nNone.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell calculates the power spectral density (PSD) of the neural activity in the pre- and post-stimulation windows using Welch's method, and then plots the PSD for frequencies below 500 Hz. It uses a logarithmic scale for the y-axis (power/frequency) to better visualize the differences in power across frequencies. The plot displays the pre-stimulus PSD in blue and the post-stimulus PSD in red, allowing for a visual comparison of the frequency content of the neural activity before and after stimulation.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe image is a plot of power spectral density (PSD) versus frequency for electrode 16. The x-axis represents \"Frequency (Hz),\" ranging from 0 to 500 Hz. The y-axis represents \"Power/Frequency (V^2/Hz)\" on a logarithmic scale. The plot displays two curves: a blue line representing the \"Pre-stimulus\" PSD and a red line representing the \"Post-stimulus\" PSD. Both curves generally increase in power as frequency increases. The post-stimulus PSD is slightly higher than the pre-stimulus PSD for most frequencies, indicating an increase in power across the spectrum after stimulation.\n\nISSUES:\nNone.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell adds a caveat regarding the limitations of the frequency resolution of the PSD calculation, particularly at low frequencies like the Delta band. It explains that the combination of sampling rate, windowing, and segment length might not be optimal for capturing these low-frequency components accurately. The cell also suggests further steps for a more detailed analysis of these bands. This note adds caution and encourages deeper investigation if the low frequency bands are of particular interest.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThere are no images in this cell.\n\nISSUES:\nNone.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell defines frequency bands (Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, High) and calculates the average power within each band for the pre- and post-stimulation periods. It prints the band power values and the ratio of post- to pre-stimulation power for each band. Then, it calculates the percent change in power for each band after stimulation and plots these changes using a bar plot. The note about missing bands due to insufficient data is a nice touch.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe image is a bar plot titled \"Percent Change in Band Power After Stimulation - Electrode 16\". The x-axis represents \"Frequency Band\", and the y-axis represents \"Percent Change (%)\". There are five blue bars, representing the percent change in power for Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and High bands.\n- Theta band: Positive, approximately 380%\n- Alpha band: Positive, approximately 35%\n- Beta band: Positive, approximately 7%\n- Gamma band: Negative, approximately -20%\n- High band: Negative, approximately -20%\nA note at the top of the plot says \"Note: Delta band(s) not shown (insufficient data)\". A horizontal black line is drawn at y=0.\n\nISSUES:\nNone.",

    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell calculates and plots the trial-averaged neural response of electrode 16 over a 500 ms window following the stimulus onset, averaging over the first 50 trials. It also calculates and displays the standard deviation across trials. It plots the mean response as a solid blue line and shades the area representing \u00b11 standard deviation around the mean. A red dashed vertical line marks the stimulus onset time.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe image is a line plot titled \"Trial-Averaged Neural Response - Electrode 16\". The x-axis represents \"Time from Stimulus Onset (s)\", ranging from 0 to 0.5 seconds. The y-axis represents \"Voltage (V)\". A blue line represents the mean response of the electrode. Shaded in light blue around the line is the area representing \u00b11 standard deviation. A vertical red dashed line represents \"Stim Onset\" at time 0. The plot shows a fluctuating electrical signal with a mean close to zero.\n\nISSUES:\nNone.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell sets the stage for the next section, where data from a different subject will be examined and compared to the previous results.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThere are no images in this cell.\n\nISSUES:\nNone.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell loads the second NWB file, this time from subject BH625, using the `load_nwb_file` function defined earlier. It prints a message to indicate the loading process. Afterwards, it prints basic metadata for the second subject. The UserWarning messages in the output are related to version conflicts in the hdmf namespace which is probably not severe, but should be noted.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThere are no images in this cell.\n\nISSUES:\nNone. However, the UserWarning should be investigated to ensure proper compatibility.",

    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell defines a function, `analyze_trial_spectral`, to calculate and return the PSD for a specified trial and electrode in a given NWB file. It then calls this function to obtain the pre- and post-stimulation PSDs for trial 5 of electrode 16 for both subjects (BH589 and BH625).  Finally, it generates a plot comparing the PSDs. The plot has two subplots, one for each subject, displaying the pre- and post-stimulation PSDs, limited to frequencies below 500 Hz, on a semi-logarithmic scale.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe image contains two subplots, each displaying power spectral density (PSD) versus frequency for a different subject. Both subplots have the same y axis (\"Power/Frequency (V^2/Hz)\") which has a log scale, and the x axis is frequency in Hz from 0 to 500.\n\nSubplot 1 is titled \"Subject BH589 - Power Spectral Density\". The pre-stimulus PSD is shown as a dashed blue line and the post-stimulus PSD is shown as a solid blue line. The post-stimulus PSD is higher at nearly all frequencies.\n\nSubplot 2 is titled \"Subject BH625 - Power Spectral Density\". The pre-stimulus PSD is shown as a dashed red line and the post-stimulus PSD is shown as a solid red line. The post-stimulus PSD is higher at nearly all frequencies.\n\nISSUES:\nNone.",

    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell defines a function `calculate_band_power_changes` that computes the percent change in power for each frequency band based on the pre- and post-stimulation PSDs. It calls this function for both subjects and then generates a bar plot comparing the percent changes across subjects. The plot shows the percent change in power for each band, with blue bars representing subject BH589 and red bars representing subject BH625. A note is included if any bands are missing. Lastly, it closes the NWB file connections to free up resources.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe image is a bar plot comparing the percent change in band power after stimulation for two subjects. The plot is titled \"Percent Change in Band Power After Stimulation - Subject Comparison\". The x-axis represents \"Frequency Band\", and the y-axis represents \"Percent Change in Power (%)\". Blue bars represent \"Subject BH589\", and red bars represent \"Subject BH625\". Only Beta, Gamma, and High bands are shown. For the Beta band, BH589 shows a higher percentage change than BH625. For the Gamma band, both subjects show small changed near 0. For the High band, BH625 shows a positive change while BH589 shows a negative change.
