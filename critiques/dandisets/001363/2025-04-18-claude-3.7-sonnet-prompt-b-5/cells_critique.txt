Cell 18
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell generates a scatter plot visualizing the electrode positions based on the 'x' and 'y' coordinates from the electrode DataFrame. The color of each point represents the electrode index, providing a visual representation of the electrode array configuration. The plot includes a colorbar indicating the electrode index, labeled axes, a title, and gridlines for better readability. The `plt.tight_layout()` function ensures that the plot elements fit within the figure boundaries.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image is a scatter plot visualizing the electrode positions. The x-axis represents the "X position (μm)" and ranges from approximately -2 to 27. The y-axis represents the "Y position (μm)" and ranges from 0 to approximately 800. There are two vertical clusters of evenly spaced circles, one located around x=0 and the other around x=25. The circles are colored according to their electrode index, using a 'viridis' colormap ranging from dark purple (index 0) to yellow (index 30+). A colorbar on the right side of the plot maps the color to the electrode index. The plot has a title "Electrode Positions" and gridlines.

Cell 21
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell retrieves trial information from the NWB file and converts it into a Pandas DataFrame. It then prints the total number of trials and the first few rows of the DataFrame showing the start and stop times for each trial. This allows the user to understand how trials are defined and how many trials are present in the file.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 22
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell calculates the duration of each trial and the inter-trial interval. It then prints descriptive statistics (count, mean, standard deviation, min, max, and quartiles) for both trial durations and inter-trial intervals. The `describe()` function provides a summary of the distribution for these values. The last trial's interval calculation is excluded since it has no subsequent trial, and the relevant iloc is used to do this correctly.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 23
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell creates a line plot illustrating the start times of each trial. The x-axis represents the trial number, and the y-axis represents the start time in seconds. The plot has a title, labeled axes, and gridlines. This visualization helps understand temporal progression of the trials.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image is a line plot titled "Trial Start Times". The x-axis represents "Trial Number", ranging from 0 to 500. The y-axis represents "Start Time (seconds)" and ranges from approximately 0 to 1000. There is a blue line with circular markers showing the start time of each trial as a function of the trial number. The start times increase linearly with the trial number, indicating the trials are evenly spaced. The plot includes gridlines.

ISSUES:
None

Cell 24
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell plots a histogram of the inter-trial intervals for all trials (excluding the last trial). The x-axis represents the inter-trial interval in seconds, and the y-axis shows the count (frequency) of each interval. This histogram provides a visual representation of the distribution of inter-trial intervals.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image is a histogram titled "Distribution of Inter-Trial Intervals". The x-axis represents "Interval (seconds)" and ranges approximately from 1.8 to 2.2. The y-axis represents "Count". The histogram shows the distribution of inter-trial intervals, with multiple bars indicating the frequency of occurrence of specific interval durations. The distribution appears to be roughly uniform across the interval range with some peaks and valleys.

ISSUES:
None

Cell 25
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell provides an interpretation of the results from the previous two cells. It correctly identifies the consistent trial durations and the variability in the inter-trial intervals. It also suggests a plausible reason for the jitter in the inter-trial intervals: to prevent neural adaptation. However, the average inter-trial interval quoted, 2.5 seconds, does not match the result from the descriptive statistics (mean = 2.002199 seconds). Also, the range quoted for inter-trial intervals, 2.25 to 2.75 seconds, is incorrect based on the results from descriptive statistics and the histogram.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
The interpretation gives the incorrect average inter-trial interval (2.5 should be 2.0) and range (2.25-2.75 should be approximately 1.8 to 2.2, based on the histogram).

Cell 27
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell retrieves the electrical series data from the NWB file's acquisition.

This provides key information about the recording's parameters.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 28
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell extracts data for the first trial. It determines the start and stop times of the first trial from `trials_df`, then converts those times into indices based on the electrical series' sampling rate. It adds a 0.5-second padding before the start of the trial to capture pre-trial activity (with max to prevent negative indices if the start time is very close to 0). It extracts the corresponding data from the `electrical_series.data` array, and sets up a time vector `trial_time` to correspond to the extracted data.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 29
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell plots the raw voltage traces from selected channels (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30) for the first trial. It offsets each channel by a small amount for better visualization and adds vertical lines to indicate the stimulation start and end times. The x-axis is the time relative to stimulation onset (with added padding), and the y-axis represents the voltage in Volts.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image is a line plot of raw voltage traces from the first trial. The x-axis is labeled "Time (s) relative to stimulation onset" and ranges from approximately -0.5 to 1.7. The y-axis is labeled "Voltage (V) - Channels stacked". There are seven voltage traces, each corresponding to a different channel (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30). The traces are offset vertically for better visibility. Two vertical dashed red lines indicate the start (x=0) and end (x=1.5) of the stimulation period. There appear to be small voltage deflections/spikes around the onset of stimulus in some channels, for example channels 0, 5, and 10.

ISSUES:
None

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:

ISSUES:
None

Cell 32
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell computes and plots a spectrogram for channel 0 of the first trial's data. It selects a channel, defines the fast Fourier transform window size and overlap (200ms window with 50% overlap), and then uses `scipy.signal.spectrogram` to compute the spectrogram. The spectrogram is then plotted using `plt.pcolormesh`, with time relative to the stimulation onset on the x-axis, frequency on the y-axis, and power spectral density as the color. The frequency is capped at 5 kHz for visualization. Vertical lines indicate the stimulation start and end times.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image is a spectrogram for channel 0, showing the power spectral density as a function of time and frequency. The x-axis is "Time (s) relative to stimulation onset" ranging from approximately -0.3 to 1.6. The y-axis is "Frequency (Hz)" ranging from 0 to 5000. The color represents "Power/Frequency (dB/Hz)", according to the colorbar on the right, ranging from approximately -120 dB/Hz (dark purple) to -116 dB/Hz (yellow). There appear to be some horizontal bands with increased power at frequencies below 1000 Hz. There is a bright yellow area around time 0 and frequencies from 100-200 Hz which is stimulus related. Two vertical dashed red lines indicate the start (x=0) and end (x=1.5) of the stimulation period.

ISSUES:
None

This cell introduces the shift towards analyzing multiple trials in order to get a better visualization by averaging.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 35
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell extracts data from multiple trials (up to 10 or the total number of trials if it's less than 10). It iterates through those trials, converts start/stop times to indices, extracts the data for a fixed time window (based on calculated duration/length of the *first* trial), and appends the trial data. Then, it stacks all trial data into a 3D numpy array, where axis 0 is trial number. Finally, it computes the average response across trials (average across axis 0), and generates the time vector based on the sample rate. This prepares the data for plotting the average across trials.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 36
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell plots the average voltage traces across the selected channels for the first `num_trials_to_average` trials (defaulting to 10). It iterates through the channels, plots the average voltage trace with an offset for clearer visualization, and adds labels, title, and gridlines to the plot. The x-axis is "Time (s) from stimulation onset" and the y-axis represents the voltage (V). The y axis label is inconsistent with the x axis in that the "relative to" has been dropped.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image is a plot of average voltage traces across multiple trials. The x-axis is "Time (s) from stimulation onset", ranging from approximately 0.0 to 1.5. The y-axis is "Voltage (V) - Channels stacked". There are seven voltage traces, each corresponding to a different channel (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30). The traces are offset vertically for better visibility. The variability seems to have been averaged away leaving relatively flat traces, with higher amplitude channels showing some low amplitude higher frequency variation.

ISSUES:
Small typo in the y axis: "Time (s) from stimulation onset" should read "Time (s) *relative to* stimulation onset".

Cell 37
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell describes the plot of the average voltage traces. It accurately states that averaging can reveal consistent responses while reducing noise and observes relatively stable activity.

Cell 39
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell loads a second NWB file (the fifth asset in the list) to compare different stimulation parameters. It constructs the download URL, loads the remote NWB file, and prints the session ID of the second session. The printed session ID confirms that this session has different stimulation parameters compared to the first session.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 40
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell defines a function `analyze_trial_data` to extract and analyze data for a single trial from an NWB file, focusing on a specific channel. The function takes an NWB file object, trial index, and channel number as inputs. It retrieves trial data, converts start and stop times into indices, extracts the data, and computes the spectrogram of the extracted data. It then returns a dictionary containing the trial time, trial data, spectrogram data (frequencies `f`, times `t`, and power spectral density `Sxx`), the start and stop times and the trial duration). The function includes padding before the trial start and prevents out-of-bounds errors.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 41
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell utilizes the previously defined `analyze_trial_data` function to extract data from the first trial and channel 0 of both NWB files (`nwb` and `nwb_2`). It stores the results in `data_session1` and `data_session2` respectively, and includes the respective session identifiers from nwb.identifier and nwb_2.identifier.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 42
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell plots the raw voltage traces for the first trial from both sessions on the same plot for comparison. It uses different colors (blue and red) to distinguish the sessions and labels them with their session IDs. Vertical lines indicate the stimulation start and end times; these lines appear to use the duration from data_session1 only (the duration is the same for both trials). The x-axis represents the Time (s) relative to stimulation onset, and the y-axis represents Voltage (V).

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image shows a comparison of raw voltage traces from first trial of two different sessions, Session 1 and Session 2. The x-axis represents 'Time (s) relative to stimulation onset' ranging from approximately -0.5 to 2. The y-axis represents 'Voltage (V)'. The graph displays two voltage traces: a blue trace for Session 1 (BH643_4500_67_50V) and a red trace for Session 2 (BH643_1500_200_10V). Both traces show fluctuations over time, but Session 1 shows greater, stimulus-locked deflections around the stimulus onset and offset. Two vertical, dashed black lines indicate the start (0s) and end (1.5s) of stimulation. It appears that Session 1 has a noticeably larger response at time zero.

ISSUES:
None

Cell 43
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell compares the spectrograms from the first trial of both sessions side-by-side. It creates a figure with two subplots, and plots the spectrogram for each session (using data from `data_session1` and `data_session2`). The plots share the same y-axis (Frequency). Vertical lines indicate the stimulation start and end times on each subplot, using the session-specific duration. The x-axis label is included only for the bottom plots. A colorbar is shared for both plots. The title is set at the figure level with `plt.suptitle`.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image contains a 1x2 arrangement of spectrograms, one for each session (Session 1 and Session 2). Each spectrogram visualizes signal power as a function of time (x-axis) and frequency (y-axis). The shared y-axis shows `Frequency (Hz)` ranging from 0 to 5000. The x-axes show 'Time (s) relative to stimulation onset'. Red dashed lines mark the start and end of the stimulation epochs in each plot. A colorbar on the right indicates `Power/Frequency (dB/Hz)`. Session 1 (BH643_4500_67_50V) has clearly visible stimulus-related spectral changes around the stimulus onset, particularly enhanced power between approximately 100-200 Hz. There are faint horizontal lines in both spectrograms. There is a faint, very short vertical blue line at about 4500 Hz in Session 1 at the stimulus onset.

This cell introduces the analysis of specific frequency bands to see how they are affected by different stimulation parameters.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:

Cell 45
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell calculates the average power in different frequency bands for each session. It defines frequency bands (Delta/Theta, Alpha/Beta, Low Gamma, and High Gamma/Multi-unit) as tuples of (min frequency, max frequency, band name). It defines a helper function `calculate_band_powers` to calculate average power in these different frequency bands from the data dict, including calculating the average spectrogram power within the frequency band during stimulus presentation. It extracts the band indices where the spectrogram frequency, `spec["f"]`, is within the frequency band, and the stimulus indices, where the spectrogram time `spec["t"]` is within the duration of stimulus presentation time.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 46
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell generates a bar plot comparing the average power in different frequency bands during the stimulation period for the two sessions. The plot includes bars for each frequency band (Delta/Theta, Alpha/Beta, Low Gamma, High Gamma/Multi-unit) from each session, distinguished by color. The code iterates through the frequency bands, extracts average band power calculated earlier from each session, and plots them as adjacent bars. This facilitates a direct visual comparison of band powers across the two sessions. The x-axis shows the frequency bands, the y-axis represents the average power, and the plot includes a title and legend.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image is a bar plot titled "Comparison of Power in Different Frequency Bands During Stimulation". The x-axis represents "Frequency Band" with four categories: "Delta/Theta (0-100 Hz)", "Alpha/Beta (100-500 Hz)", "Low Gamma (500-1000 Hz)", and "High Gamma/Multi-unit (1000-5000 Hz)". The y-axis represents "Average Power (dB)". For each frequency band, there are two bars: a blue bar representing "Session 1 (BH643_4500_67_50V)" and a red bar representing "Session 2 (BH643_1500_200_10V)". All the values hover at around -100 dB -- this is most likely noise.

ISSUES:
None

Cell 47
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell contains a qualitative summary of the code and plots. It states that the code compares different neural responses, that different frequency bands are affected, and that these differences could point to distinct neural mechanisms activated by transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation.

Cell 48
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell presents a summary of the key findings and observations made throughout the notebook, and proposes future directions for further analysis of the dataset. The key findings cover the dataset structure, electrode configuration, trial structure, neural responses, frequency analysis, and the effect of varying stimulation parameters. The future directions include systematic comparison of parameters, advanced signal processing, machine learning approaches, spike detection/sorting, and cross-session comparisons. Point 3 of the key findings is incorrect, it has already been noted that the inter-trial intervals average around 2.0 seconds. Also worth noting is that *all* the values of average power were around -100db which is consistent with noise, so all the further directions may not be very helpful.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
The inter-trial intervals were not averaging around 2.5 seconds. They were averaging around 2.0 seconds. All the values for average power are around -100dB which is more consistent with noise, so the conclusion that spectral analysis identified stimulation-specific effects visible in different frequency ranges should be examined further.
