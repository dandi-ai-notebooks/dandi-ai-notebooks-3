Cell 1
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell is a combination of title, introduction, and table of contents/outline. It sets the stage for the rest of the notebook, providing an overview of Dandiset 000673, including its focus on working memory and phase-amplitude coupling in human brain recordings. It also outlines the structure of the notebook, guiding the reader through the steps of loading, exploring metadata, visualizing data, and suggesting future analyses. The initial disclaimer about the AI-generated nature of the notebook is important.

Cell 2
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell lists the necessary Python packages for running the notebook. This is crucial for reproducibility, allowing users to set up their environment correctly before executing the code.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None


Cell 3
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell imports the necessary Python libraries. `dandi.dandiapi` provides access to DANDI datasets. `pynwb` is used for working with Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files. `h5py` is a general library for interacting with HDF5 files, which NWB files are based on. `remfile` is likely used for accessing files remotely. `pandas` and `numpy` are used for data manipulation and analysis. `matplotlib.pyplot` is used for plotting.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None


Cell 4
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell introduces the next section, which focuses on loading the specified Dandiset (000673) using the DANDI API. It prepares the reader for the code that will perform the data loading.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 5
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell uses the DANDI API to access Dandiset 000673. It initializes a `DandiAPIClient`, retrieves the specified dandiset, and gets a list of assets (NWB files) within the dandiset. The code then prints the total number of assets and the paths of the first five assets to give the user a sense of the dataset's structure.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 6
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell introduces the next phase, which focuses on loading and exploring the metadata associated with the NWB files/assets retrieved in the previous cell. It explicitly states that PyNWB will be used for this purpose.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 7
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell focuses on loading and exploring the metadata from a specific NWB file within the Dandiset. It uses a hardcoded URL to download a single NWB file "65a7e913-45c7-48db-bf19-b9f5e910110a". Then, it uses `remfile`, `h5py`, and `pynwb` to open the file and extract key metadata elements (session description, identifier, session start time, and experimenter). The extracted metadata is then printed to the console.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
1.  **Hardcoded URL:** The hardcoded URL is problematic. It makes the notebook less general and less useful as a template for exploring other files in the Dandiset. It would be better to select an asset dynamically from the `assets` list obtained earlier, perhaps using an index or a more descriptive selection criterion.
2.  **Warning Messages:** The code produces several warning messages related to namespace versions and the shape of the `ElectricalSeries` data. While these might not be fatal errors, they indicate potential inconsistencies or issues that should be investigated and addressed for robustness. The warning about potentially transposed data is particularly important and should be checked.


Cell 8
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell introduces the visualization of data from the NWB file, specifically focusing on Local Field Potential (LFP) data and events. It prepares the reader for the subsequent code that will generate the visualizations.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None


Cell 9
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell generates a basic plot of LFP data. It accesses the LFP data from the loaded NWB file, takes a subset (first 1000 time points and first 10 channels), and plots the data using `matplotlib`. The plot displays the amplitude of the LFP signals over time for the selected channels.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The plot shows the time series of LFP signals for 10 different channels. The x-axis represents time in milliseconds, ranging from 0 to 1000. The y-axis represents the amplitude of the LFP signal in volts. There are 10 lines on the plot, each representing a different channel. Several channels show a large deflection/drift downward during the time period.

ISSUES:
1.  **Units:** The x-axis label says "Time (ms)". However, NWB files store sampling rate, not time. The code doesn't appear to take the sampling rate into account when labeling the x-axis. This could be misleading if the sampling rate is not 1 kHz.
2.  **Channel Identification**: The plot does not indicate which channel each line represents, making it difficult to interpret the data.
3.  **Misleading title**: The title of the axis says, "Amplitude (V)", but it's unclear if the data truly represents voltage given that the raw data could be in arbitrary units (e.g. ADC counts) and that voltage offset could've been removed. If the dataset contains calibration information (e.g. volts per ADC count), the code should've used it here. At the very least, the y-axis label should say "Amplitude (a.u.)" or similar if the data is in arbitrary units.
4.  **Lack of sampling rate.** Also, the code should check and display the sampling rate to allow the user to interpret the x axis correctly.

Cell 10
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell introduces the next visualization, which will display information about stimulus presentations. This is a logical next step, as stimulus information is crucial for understanding the experimental context of the neural data.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 11
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell attempts to visualize event data from the NWB file. It loads a subset of the event data (first 20 data points) and plots it as a line with markers. The x-axis represents the event index, and the y-axis is labeled "Event Type."

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The plot shows a line graph with circles marking the data points. The x-axis is labeled "Event Index," ranging from 0 to 19. The y-axis is labeled "Event Type," ranging from roughly 0 to 60. The first data point is very high, around 60, and then drops significantly to around 10. After that, the values fluctuate between 0 and 10.

ISSUES:
1.  **Lack of Context:** The plot is very difficult to interpret because it lacks context. What does "event type" represent? Without knowing the meaning of the numerical values on the y-axis, the plot is essentially meaningless. The notebook should provide more information about how events are encoded in the NWB file and what the values represent.
2.  **Potential for Improvement:** Given that timestamps are available in NWB files for the events, it might be more informative to plot them as a function of time, or create a raster plot showing the occurrences of different event types over time.
3.  **Inaccurate Title:** The title is "Events Data (subset)", but since the data is called `events` in the acquisition object of the NWB file, it is unclear if these really represent stimulus events. It would be good for the notebook to clarify which data is being plotted.

Cell 12
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell concludes the notebook by summarizing what has been done and suggesting future directions for analysis. It reiterates the potential to investigate phase-amplitude coupling and its relation to working memory, tying back to the original focus of the Dandiset.
