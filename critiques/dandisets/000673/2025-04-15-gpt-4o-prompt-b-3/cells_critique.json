    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell is an introduction to the notebook. It provides the title, which indicates the focus on Dandiset 000673 and its contents related to phase-amplitude coupling of hippocampal neurons and working memory. The note warns the user that the notebook is AI-generated and may contain inaccuracies, advising caution in interpreting the code and results. This is important context for anyone using the notebook, setting expectations about its reliability.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell provides a brief overview of the scientific content of the Dandiset (000673). It states the central topic (phase-amplitude coupling in working memory), the brain regions involved (medial temporal and frontal lobes), and the experimental setup (a working memory task). This is useful for understanding the context of the data and the potential analyses that can be performed.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell expands on the overview by listing the main components of the research within the Dandiset. It highlights the recording of single neuron activity, the focus on theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling as a key interaction, and the types of data used (LFP and events). This further clarifies the scope and nature of the data contained within the Dandiset.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell lists the necessary Python packages for running the code in the notebook. It includes `pynwb` (for reading NWB files), `h5py` (for working with HDF5 files), `numpy` (for numerical computation), `matplotlib` (for plotting), and `remfile` (presumably for remote file handling). A user can utilize this cell as a checklist before attempting to execute the subsequent cells.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell loads the metadata about the Dandiset with ID \"000673\" from the DANDI Archive using the `dandiapi` client. It retrieves the list of assets (files) within the Dandiset. Finally, it prints the number of assets found and the paths of the first five assets. This cell establishes a connection to the DANDI archive and lists the available files.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell aims to load, extract, and visualize LFP (Local Field Potential) data from a specified NWB file within the Dandiset. It uses `remfile` to access the remote NWB file, `h5py` to interact with the HDF5 structure, and `pynwb` to read the NWB data. It extracts the first 1000 timepoints of the first 10 channels from the LFP data. Finally, it generates a plot showing the LFP data for the selected channels over time, with each channel offset vertically for better visualization.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe plot visualizes LFP data from the first 10 channels of recording. The x-axis represents time in seconds, and the y-axis represents voltage. Each channel's data is plotted as a separate line, with a small vertical offset between channels for clarity. The plot displays the fluctuations in voltage over time for each channel. The legend indicates which line corresponds to which channel number. The title indicates that the plot is showing the LFP data for the first 10 channels.\n\nISSUES:\nThe y-axis label is \"Voltage [V]\" which is correct, but the plot itself is unitless. This is because the values `selected_data` is added to `i*0.1`. The plot would be improved if the unitless addition was replaced with correct scaling/offsetting. Also, the y-axis label should include the offset added to make better sense of the voltage scale.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell summarizes the notebook's purpose as a starting point for exploring the Dandiset. It suggests further analyses, such as examining phase-amplitude coupling in relation to cognitive tasks and performing inter-subject comparisons. It also closes the NWB file and the HDF5 file to release resources.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n"
