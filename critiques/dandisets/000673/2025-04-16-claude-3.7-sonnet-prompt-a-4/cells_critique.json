    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell analyzes the spiking activity of a single neuron during the maintenance period of the Sternberg task, comparing activity across different memory loads (1, 2, and 3). A function `get_maintenance_spikes` is defined to extract spikes occurring during the maintenance period for each trial and normalize spike times relative to the start and end (probe onset) of the maintenance period. Raster plots are then generated for each memory load, showing the normalized spike times for each trial on the y-axis. Vertical blue and red lines indicate the start and end of the maintenance period, respectively.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe image contains three raster plots, one for each memory load (1, 2, and 3), depicting the spike activity of a single unit during the maintenance period. The x-axis represents the normalized time within the maintenance period, from 0 (maintenance start) to 1 (probe onset). The y-axis represents individual trials for each load. Each black vertical line represents a spike. Blue dashed lines mark the maintenance start (x=0), and red dashed lines mark the probe onset (x=1). The 'Load 2 Trials' subplot is empty, indicating a lack of spikes or potentially of trials for that load. The top subplot displays 'Load 1 trials (n=70)' and the bottom subplot displays 'Load 3 Trials (n=70)'. Load 3 has slightly more dense representation of spikes. The title of the figure is 'Maintenance Period Spike Activity for Unit 0 by Memory Load'.\n\nISSUES:\nThe \"Load 2 Trials\" subplot is completely empty, suggesting an issue in the data or code that prevents spikes (or trials) from being analyzed for load 2. This should be investigated.",

    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell retrieves stimulus presentation information from the NWB file, including the number of presentations and unique images.

The cell then prints the first few rows of the resulting DataFrame.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nThe \"image_id\" column in the output DataFrame displays the raw RGB pixel data for each image instead of the actual image ID string. The code attempts to map the image index to image IDs from the stimulus templates, but apparently it does not work as expected.\n\nThis can be mitigated by converting the `image_id_mapping` keys and values to strings before mapping `stim_df`.\n\n```\n# Match image indices to image IDs\nimage_id_mapping = {}\nfor i, img_id in enumerate(stimulus_templates.order_of_images[:]):\n    image_id_mapping[str(i)] = img_id\n\nstim_df['image_id'] = stim_df['image_index'].astype(str).map(image_id_mapping)\n```",

The plot provides an overview of the sequence and timing of stimulus presentations throughout the experiment.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe image is a scatter plot titled \"Timeline of Stimulus Presentations.\" The x-axis is labeled \"Time (seconds).\" The y-axis is labeled \"Image Index\". Each dot represents a stimulus presentation event, so the dot's x value represents the time and the y value is the index of the image that was presented.
