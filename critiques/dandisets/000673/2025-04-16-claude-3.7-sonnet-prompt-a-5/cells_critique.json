The accuracy value is displayed above each bar.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe image is a bar plot that visualizes task performance by memory load. The x-axis represents the memory load (number of items), with two categories: 1 and 3. The y-axis represents accuracy in percentage, ranging from 0 to 100. There are two bars, one for each memory load, displaying the average accuracy for that load. The bar for memory load 1 reaches 100% accuracy, while the bar for memory load 3 indicates an accuracy of 98.6%. Numerical values of the accuracy are displayed above each bar.\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell generates a bar plot displaying the accuracy of the subject based on trial type (probe in memory vs. probe not in memory).

    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell serves as a transition, indicating the next section will focus on analyzing response times within the working memory task.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell analyzes the response times (RTs) in the working memory task. First, it calculates the RTs by subtracting the `timestamps_Probe` from `timestamps_Response`. It then filters out invalid RTs (negative or extremely large, using a cutoff of 10 seconds). The cell then generates four subplots. The first two subplots are histograms showing distributions of RTs colored by accuracy and trial type, respectively. The third subplot is a bar plot showing the average RT by memory load. The fourth subplot is a bar plot showing the average RT by trial type and accuracy, resulting in 3 conditions since there was only 1 incorrect trial.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe image contains four subplots arranged in a 2x2 grid, all related to response time analysis.\n\n1.  **Response Time Distribution by Accuracy**: This histogram displays the distribution of response times, separated by accuracy. The x-axis represents response time in seconds, and the y-axis represents the count of trials. Two distributions are overlaid: one for incorrect trials (in orange) and one for correct trials (in blue). The distribution for incorrect trials is appears to have much higher counts near shorter response times but it is difficult to assess the distribution of correct trials because there is only one.\n2.  **Response Time Distribution by Trial Type**: This histogram shows the distribution of response times based on trial type. The x-axis represents response time in seconds, and the y-axis represents the count of trials. Two distributions are overlaid: \"Not in Memory\" (in orange) and \"In Memory\" (in blue). Both distributions seem to be have higher counts near shorter response times, but the \"In Memory\" condition might be shifted slightly right.\n3.  **Response Time by Memory Load**: This bar plot shows the average response time for different memory loads. The x-axis represents the memory load, with two values: 1 and 3. The y-axis represents the average response time in seconds. The average response time appears slightly higher for a memory load of 3 than for a memory load of 1, though the y-axis isn't labeled very precisely.\n4.  **Response Time by Trial Type and Accuracy**: This bar plot displays the average response time for different conditions of trial type and accuracy. The x-axis lists the conditions: \"Out-Correct\", \"In-Incorrect\", and \"In-Correct\". The y-axis represents the average response time in seconds. \"In-Incorrect\" has larger average response time than \"Out-Correct\" or \"In-Correct\".\n\nISSUES:\nThe title of plot 1 is \"Response Time Distribution by Accuracy\". However, because of the extremely low number of incorrect trials, the histogram of response times by accuracy is not very meaningful. Plot 2 is similarly affected.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the next section, which focuses on exploring stimulus images used in the experiment. It serves as a transition to the image visualization part of the notebook.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell retrieves a list of image keys from the NWB file and then iterates through the first nine keys to display the corresponding images. The images are accessed from `nwb.stimulus_template['StimulusTemplates'].images[key].data[:]` and are displayed using `plt.imshow()`. Each image is labeled with its corresponding key as the title.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe image displays a 3x3 grid of images. Each image appears to be a photograph of a person. The photos appear to be rotated either clockwise or counter-clockwise. The titles above each image indicate the image key in the format \"Image image_XXX,\" where XXX is a number from 101 to 109.\n\nISSUES:\nThe images are displayed rotated, which could be disorienting for the viewer and makes it somewhat more difficult to discern the exact stimulus. This rotation might be intentional in the original experiment, but it would be helpful to mention this and explain why the images are rotated (if known).",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the next phase of the notebook: examining neural recordings from the hippocampus and amygdala. It serves as a transition to the single-unit analysis section.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell explores the neural data by extracting information about electrode groups, electrodes, and recorded units from the NWB file. It first prints the location of each electrode group. Then, it displays the electrode dataframe (`nwb.electrodes.to_dataframe()`) and the first few rows of the units dataframe (`nwb.units.to_dataframe()`). Finally, it calculates and prints the number of units recorded in each brain region based on the electrode locations by using `value_counts()`.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe cell output includes two tables and a list of regions and counts.\n\n*   The first table, labeled \"Electrodes\", is a Pandas DataFrame showing properties of the electrodes, including x, y, and z coordinates, location, filtering, group, group_name, and origChannel.\n*   The second table, labeled \"Recorded Units\", is a Pandas DataFrame showing the spike times, associated electrodes, and other data for the recorded units. The columns included are `spike_times`, `electrodes`, `clusterID_orig`, `waveforms`, `waveforms_mean_snr`, `waveforms_peak_snr`, `waveforms_isolation_distance`, and `waveforms_mean_proj_dist`.\n*   The list shows the number of units per brain region. Amygdala right has 5 units. Hippocampus left and hippocampus right have 4 units each, and amygdala left has 1 unit.\n\nISSUES:\nThe documentation of this function claims that it returns the number of units per brain region based on the electrode locations, however it does not include all units from the brain region. Specifically it is missing 14 units. This is likely due to those units being placed in bad channels, and so that is the only reason why this may not be an issue.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the visualization of neural activity, and serves as a transition cell to the subsequent plotting of spiking activity.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell generates a spike raster plot for the first five units in the dataset. It retrieves the spike times for each unit and plots them as vertical lines on the raster plot. The y-axis represents the different units. The labels for each unit are constructed by appending the electrode location to the unit ID. If a unit has more than 1000 spikes, the code samples 1000 evenly spaced spikes for plotting to improve visualization.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe image is a spike raster plot showing the spiking activity of five different units over time. The x-axis represents time in seconds, ranging from approximately 0 to 1200. The y-axis represents the different units, labeled as \"Unit 0 (unknown location)\", \"Unit 1 (unknown location)\", \"Unit 2 (unknown location)\", \"Unit 3 (unknown location)\" and \"Unit 4 (unknown location)\". Each black vertical line on the plot represents a single spike event for a given unit at a specific time. The density and patterns of these lines indicate the firing rate and temporal dynamics of each unit. The units seem to have varying degrees of firing activity.\n\nISSUES:\nThe location of electrodes is showing up as \"unknown location\". This is because although there is an error thrown, it defaults to \"unknown location\", but the try/except block masks the underlying error in retrieving electrode locations for certain units. This makes it difficult to interpret any differences in spiking patterns between units. It would be better to understand why the electrode locations cannot be determined so that the plot could be labeled with the anatomical location for each unit.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the analysis of neural activity around trial events, specifically focusing on creating a peri-stimulus time histogram (PSTH) around probe presentation. It acts as a transition to the PSTH analysis section.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell defines a function `create_psth` that calculates the peri-stimulus time histogram (PSTH) for a given set of spike times and event times. The function takes the spike times, event times, a time window, and bin size as inputs. It aligns the spike times to each event time, counts the number of spikes falling within each bin of the specified window, and then converts the counts to firing rates (Hz).\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell selects the probe onset times from the trials DataFrame and stores them in the `probe_times` variable. It then creates separate arrays for correct, incorrect, in-memory, and not-in-memory trials based on \"response_accuracy\" and \"probe_in_out\" columns within the `trials_df`.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell attempts to select a unit from the hippocampus and create PSTHs aligned to the probe onset times. It first filters the `units_df` dataframe to identify units recorded from the hippocampus. If hippocampal units are found, the code proceeds to select the first hippocampal unit and extract its spike times. It creates PSTHs for all trials, correct/incorrect trials, and in-memory/not-in-memory trials. The code then generates three subplots displaying the PSTHs for each trial type. Each plot includes a vertical line indicating the probe onset time. However, because the unit selection process fails in this particular notebook run, it prints \"No units from hippocampus found for this subject\".\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nSince there are no units from the hippocampus identified on this run, the code skips the plotting commands, and no plots are created.\n\nISSUES:\nThe code reports \"No units from hippocampus found for this subject\". This is unexpected since hippocampus units were apparently found in the previous cell (electrode counts reported 4 units in each of left and right hippocampus). The issue might stem from filtering units based on the electrodes' location string, which may or not actually contain the substring \u2018hippocampus\u2019. Some debugging is needed to reveal the true reason for this failure. Also (although this is irrelevant because the code block doesn't run), the number of incorrect probe times is expected to be very low from a previous cell, which may cause problems when creating PSTH for incorrect trials.\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell functions as a transition, introducing the comparison of neural activity between hippocampus and amygdala units. This prepares the reader for the subsequent analysis.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell aims to identify and count the number of units located in the hippocampus and amygdala. It iterates through the unit IDs, retrieves the corresponding electrode ID and location, and appends the unit ID to either `hippocampus_unit_ids` or `amygdala_unit_ids` based on whether the location string contains the substring 'hippocampus' or 'amygdala', respectively. Finally, it prints the total number of hippocampus and amygdala units found.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nThe counts for units are `0` for both regions, which is unexpected since the printed output from an earlier cell showed 4 units each in hippocampus_left and hippocampus_right, and 5 units in amygdala_right and 1 in amygdala left. Therefore, the unit selection is failing, likely due to the string matching on location. Because of this issue, any downstream analysis based on these selections will also fail.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell attempts to compare neural activity between one representative unit from the hippocampus and one from the amygdala. Since there are no hippocampus and amygdala units selected correctly in the previous cell, the code skips the plotting commands and prints \"Unable to compare hippocampus and amygdala units - not enough units available\". If units from both regions had been identified, the code would have created PSTHs aligned to both the probe onset and the maintenance period and generated plots to compare the firing rates of these units across different task events.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThere are no plots produced.\n\nISSUES:\nBecause the filtering of hippocampus and amygdala units has failed in the previous step, this cell correctly reports that it cannot perform the comparison and prints the message \"Unable to compare hippocampus and amygdala units - not enough units available\". No further issues are present in the cell itself, although the failure of the previous cell propagates here.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the final analysis step: examining how neural firing rates change with different memory loads. It prepares the reader for the memory load-specific neural activity analysis.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell defines a function `calculate_firing_rate` that calculates the mean firing rate of a neuron within specified time windows. It takes spike times, start times, and end times as inputs. The function iterates through each time window, counts the number of spikes occurring within that window, calculates the duration of the window, and then computes the firing rate by dividing the spike count by the duration.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis final cell analyzes how the firing rate of a hippocampal unit changes with different memory loads during the maintenance period. The code selects start and end times based on \"timestamps_Maintenance\" and \"timestamps_Probe\", respectively, for each trial. It then iterates through different memory loads, calculates the firing rates during the maintenance period for trials with a specific memory load, and stores these firing rates. Finally, it generates two plots: a boxplot with overlaid scatter points showing the distribution of firing rates for each memory load, and a bar plot displaying the average firing rate and standard error for each memory load. The code is skipped in this run because no hippocampal units were found.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nSince no hippocampal units are found, this cell does not produce any plots.\n\nISSUES:\nDue to the failure of selecting the hippocampal unit as identified in previous cells, the code prints the message \"No hippocampal units available for analysis\" and no plotting is done. This cell would have produced a boxplot and bar plot of firing rates, but the code errors out before reaching this point.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell summarizes the activities performed in the notebook, including loading and examining an NWB file, exploring the trial structure, visualizing behavioral performance, examining stimulus images, analyzing neural activity, creating PSTHs, comparing activity in different brain regions, and investigating how neural activity changes with memory load. It then provides a list of potential future directions for researchers to explore, such as analyzing theta and gamma oscillations, performing population-level analyses, analyzing connectivity between brain regions, comparing neural activity across subjects, and relating neural activity to individual differences in working memory performance.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nThe summary lists several analysis steps that the notebook attempted to perform however, due to code errors, many of those analysis steps were not successfully completed. The summary would benefit from a qualification that the analysis was preliminary."
