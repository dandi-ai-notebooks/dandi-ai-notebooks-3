    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell serves as the title of the Jupyter notebook, introducing the specific Dandiset (000673) that will be explored. It also provides a brief description of the experiment behind the Dandiset. This cell provides context for the rest of the notebook.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell provides a crucial disclaimer, stating that the notebook was AI-generated and might contain inaccuracies. This emphasizes the need for caution when interpreting the notebook's content. This is important for transparency and responsible use of AI-generated resources.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the purpose of the notebook: an initial exploration of Dandiset 000673. It also gives the title of the underlying study and provides a link to the Dandiset on Neurosift, enabling easy access to the data.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell outlines the key steps that will be performed in the notebook: loading metadata, visualizing LFP data, and displaying stimulus images. It clearly states the notebook's purpose as an introductory guide rather than a comprehensive analysis, and emphasizes that the notebook does not conduct any new scientific analysis.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell explicitly lists the Python packages necessary to execute the code within the notebook. This ensures that users can easily set up their environment and replicate the results.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell uses the `dandiapi` library to connect to the DANDI archive and retrieve the metadata for Dandiset 000673. It then lists the first five assets (NWB files) within the Dandiset, providing a basic overview of the data structure.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the next step: loading a specific NWB file (`sub-1/sub-1_ses-1_ecephys+image.nwb`) and displaying some of its metadata. It also provides the direct download URL for this asset. This cell prepares the user for the subsequent loading and display of data.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell loads the NWB file specified in the previous cell using `pynwb`, `h5py`, and `remfile`. It then prints the `session_description`, `identifier`, and `session_start_time` attributes of the NWB file, showcasing basic metadata. It also prints some warning messages due to version mismatch of hdmf libraries. There is also a warning regarding the potentially transposed data for ElectricalSeries 'LFPs'.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\n1.  The warning \"ElectricalSeries 'LFPs': The second dimension of data does not match the length of electrodes. Your data may be transposed.\" is important and should be addressed or at least explicitly acknowledged. The notebook should investigate if the data is indeed transposed and, if so, correct it. This impacts downstream analysis, so it is a significant issue.\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the next section, where LFP data will be loaded and visualized. This serves as a transition and sets expectations for the content that follows.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell loads LFP data from the NWB file and visualizes the distribution of LFP values for a subset of electrodes using histograms. The code selects a subset of electrodes and time points to manage computational load, and then generates a figure with multiple subplots, each displaying a histogram of LFP values for a different electrode.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe output image is a 2x5 grid of histograms. Each histogram displays the distribution of LFP values (in volts) for a specific electrode. The x-axis of each histogram represents the LFP value, and the y-axis represents the frequency (count) of occurrence of that LFP value. The title of each subplot indicates the electrode number. The histograms show varying distributions, some appearing approximately normal, while others are more skewed or bimodal.\n\nISSUES:\n1.  The y-axis labels are overlapping with the subplots. This can be fixed by adjusting the `plt.tight_layout()` parameters (e.g., `plt.tight_layout(rect=[0, 0.03, 1, 0.95])`).\n2.  The warning from the previous cell regarding potentially transposed data was ignored. The plots may be incorrect as a result.\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the final section of the notebook, focusing on loading and visualizing stimulus templates from the NWB file. This cell functions as a transition, informing the user about the content that will be presented next.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell loads stimulus template images from the NWB file and displays them in a grid. It accesses the `stimulus_template` section, selects a subset of images, and then uses `matplotlib` and `PIL` (Pillow) to display the images.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe output is a 2x5 grid of images, each representing a stimulus template. The images appear to be photographs of people (celebrities, public figures), rotated at various angles. Each image is labeled with its name (e.g., \"image\\_101\", \"image\\_102\"). All the images appear to be rotated at different angles.\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell summarizes the notebook's achievements: loading and visualizing LFP data and stimulus templates from a DANDI archive. It then proposes several potential directions for future analysis, such as advanced signal processing on the LFP data, exploring the relationship between LFP activity and stimulus presentation, and investigation of other data modalities such as spike times and trial information.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone"
