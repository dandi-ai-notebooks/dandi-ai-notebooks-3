    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell provides an introduction to the notebook, outlining its purpose, the dataset it explores (Dandiset 000673), and the types of analyses it will perform. It also lists the required Python packages, establishing the necessary environment for running the notebook. The information helps the user understand the context and prerequisites for the subsequent cells.\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\nISSUES:\nThe DANDI archive link should be updated from 001176/000673 to 000673 in the \"You can access the Dandiset directly [here](https://neurosift.app/dandiset/001176/000673).\" section.\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell serves as a heading to indicate the start of the process of connecting to the DANDI archive and loading the specified Dandiset. It prepares the user for the code that will perform these actions in the subsequent cell.\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThe code in this cell connects to the DANDI archive, retrieves Dandiset 000673, and lists the first five assets (files) within the Dandiset. It prints the number of assets found and displays the file paths of the first five assets. This cell verifies the connection to DANDI and confirms that the Dandiset has been successfully accessed.\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell is a heading that indicates the next step: loading an NWB (Neurodata Without Borders) file from the Dandiset and inspecting its metadata. It serves as a transition to the code that will perform these actions.\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell loads an NWB file from a specified URL using `remfile`, `h5py`, and `pynwb`. It then extracts and prints metadata information such as session description, identifier, session start time, and experimenter(s) from the NWB file. The code demonstrates how to access and display key information stored within the NWB file.\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\nISSUES:\nThe UserWarning from pynwb \"ElectricalSeries 'LFPs': The second dimension of data does not match the length of electrodes. Your data may be transposed.\" should be investigated. It indicates a potential issue with the LFP data or its interpretation. Although it is only a warning, it may indicate that further analysis is needed to correct the data. A brief comment indicating where the warning came from and acknowledging it might be helpful.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the visualization of LFP (Local Field Potential) data extracted from the NWB file. It prepares the user for the code that will generate a plot of the LFP data.\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell extracts LFP data from the loaded NWB file, selects the first 1000 samples from the first 10 electrodes, and plots the data. A time axis is calculated from sampling rate information in the NWB file. The plot displays the LFP signal for each of the 10 electrodes over time, with a small vertical offset added to each for better visualization. The plot includes labels, a title, and a legend.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe plot shows the LFP data from the first 10 electrodes over a time period of approximately 2.5 seconds. Each electrode's LFP signal is represented by a different colored line. The signals are vertically offset from each other so they can be distinguished clearly. The x-axis is labeled \"Time (s)\" and the y-axis is labeled \"Voltage differences (V)\". The title of the plot is \"LFP Data from First 10 Electrodes\". A legend in the upper right corner identifies each electrode. The plot uses a seaborn theme (grid background).\n\nISSUES:\nThe y-axis label \"Voltage differences (V)\" could be improved for clarity. Is it really voltage differences, or is simply voltage? Also, the vertical offset of 5e-4 (0.0005) seems a bit small and causes the traces to overlap a bit, particularly between time 1 and 2. It works (they don't overlap entirely) but increasing the offset would really help make them more distinct.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell is a placeholder for a summary of the notebook's analysis and visualization. It suggests adding potential future directions for exploring the dataset, inviting the user to reflect on what has been done and what could be done next.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nSince this is a placeholder, the absence of content is not an issue, but it should be populated in a complete notebook.\n"
