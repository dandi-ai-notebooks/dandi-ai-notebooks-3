    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the notebook's focus: Dandiset 000673, which contains data related to the control of working memory via phase-amplitude coupling in human hippocampal neurons. It sets the context for the analysis and datasets to be explored.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell provides a disclaimer that the notebook was automatically generated and might contain errors, advising users to use caution when interpreting the content. This is important for setting expectations about the notebook's reliability.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell provides a concise summary of the Dandiset (000673) and the related study by Daume et al. (2025). It highlights the focus on working memory, phase-amplitude coupling, and the brain regions involved. This gives the user a good understanding of the underlying research.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell outlines the steps that will be covered in the notebook, offering a clear roadmap for the reader. The listed steps provide a logical progression, from connecting to the archive and loading metadata to visualizing electrophysiology and stimulus data.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell lists the Python packages necessary to execute the code within the notebook. This is useful for the user to ensure they have the right dependencies to replicate the results.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the process of connecting to the DANDI archive and retrieving the target Dandiset. It sets the stage for the subsequent code that will perform this task.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell uses the `dandi-api` library to connect to the DANDI archive, retrieves Dandiset 000673, lists the assets (NWB files) within it, and prints the paths of the first five assets. This confirms connectivity with the DANDI archive and provides a list of available data files.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the loading of metadata from an NWB file within the Dandiset. It specifies the file \"sub-1/sub-1\\_ses-1\\_ecephys+image.nwb\" as the example for subsequent steps.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell uses `pynwb`, `h5py`, and `remfile` to load the NWB file specified in the previous cell from the DANDI archive. It then prints the NWB object (`nwb`), which displays the file's metadata, including fields like `acquisition`, `devices`, `electrode_groups`, `experiment_description`, etc. The output provides a detailed overview of the NWB file's contents.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nThe warning message \"ElectricalSeries 'LFPs': The second dimension of data does not match the length of electrodes. Your data may be transposed.\" is important and should be addressed in the notebook, as it potentially indicates an issue with the data's orientation. The user should be informed about this and given a hint on how to resolve it.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell serves as a header indicating that the following content will be focused on examining the contents of the NWB file loaded in the previous cell.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell accesses and prints the `session_description` attribute of the loaded NWB file. It demonstrates how to extract specific metadata information from the NWB object.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nSimilar to the previous cell, this cell accesses and prints the `identifier` attribute of the NWB file, demonstrating how to access another specific piece of metadata.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell extracts and prints the `session_start_time` attribute from the NWB file. This shows another example of how to access date and time related metadata.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the section where LFP data will be loaded and visualized. It prepares the reader for the subsequent code that performs these actions.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell imports `matplotlib`, `numpy`, and `seaborn` libraries for plotting. It then loads the LFP data from the 'LFPs' ElectricalSeries within the 'acquisition' group of the NWB file and assigns it to the variable `lfps`. The shape of the data is printed, showing the dimensions of the LFP data (samples x channels).\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell visualizes a subset of the LFP data. It selects the first 1000 timepoints for the first 10 channels and plots them. The plot displays the LFP signal over time for multiple channels, with clear labels for the axes and title.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe plot shows LFP data (voltage) on the y-axis against Timepoints on the x-axis. Ten different colored lines are plotted, representing the first ten channels of LFP data over 1000 time points. The plot shows the raw LFP data fluctuating over time. There's a general downward trend from the first 400 timepoints, and then the signal stabilizes.\n\nISSUES:\nThe y-axis label \"LFP (volts)\" is likely incorrect. The data is likely in microvolts, which is a more common unit for LFPs. This should be checked and corrected if needed, and stated clearly.\nThe warning about the data possibly being transposed, seen earlier, is not addressed here. It is possible that the channels are the rows, not the columns. If so, the data subset selection should be `lfps[:num_channels, :num_timepoints].T` to plot the time series correctly. The effect of this potential transposition error on the plot needs to be checked and accounted for.\nThere is no description of the data being plotted. What brain region are these channels from? Is this expected activity? Some context is needed.\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the section focused on loading and visualizing stimulus event data.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell loads stimulus event data and corresponding timestamps from the NWB file. It then plots the event values against time, showing the occurrences and magnitudes of stimuli over time. Only the first 100 events are plotted.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe plot displays the stimulus event data. The x-axis represents time in seconds, and the y-axis represents the event value. The plot shows a pattern of events repeated over time. There is a large event at the beginning, followed by a series of lower-value, oscillating events. The points are connected by lines.\n\nISSUES:\nThe y-axis label \"Event Value\" is vague. It needs to be clarified what these values represent. Without this information, the plot is hard to interpret. What does the initial high event likely represent? What do the oscillating events likely represent? Information available in the metadata or publication should be used to interpret these event values. Also, the plot title \"Stimulus Event Data\" could be more descriptive, like \"Stimulus Event Data over Time\".",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the loading and visualization of stimulus template images from the NWB file.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell loads the stimulus template images from the NWB file. It then prints the available image names and the shape of the first image. Finally, it displays the first image using `matplotlib.pyplot.imshow()`.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe image shows a photograph of a man in a suit giving a speech. The man is slightly rotated in the image. The image is titled \"image_101\".\n\nISSUES:\nIt would be valuable to provide some context about these images. Are they faces? Objects? What do the different image names signify (e.g. categories or IDs)? The notebook should relate these image templates to the stimulus event data visualized in the prior cell. How do the stimulus events and these templates relate?\n\nAlso, while simply printing the shape of the image is useful, displaying the data type would be as well using `first_image.data.dtype`. Image data is often stored as unsigned integers, and it's good to check.",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell summarizes what the notebook has covered and suggests future directions for analysis. It reinforces the steps demonstrated and proposes potential avenues for deeper exploration of the dataset.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone"
