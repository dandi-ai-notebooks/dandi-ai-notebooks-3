ISSUES:
None


Cell 8
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell introduces the exploration of the NWB file for the first subject, reiterating that the data comes from a subject performing the Sternberg task. It sets the context for the subsequent analysis.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 9
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell loads the NWB file using `remfile` to access it remotely, then uses `h5py` and `pynwb` to read the file into an `nwb` object. The warnings in the output indicate potential version conflicts with hdmf namespaces and a potential issue with the dimensions of the LFP data.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
The warnings in the output about hdmf namespaces and LFP data dimensions are potential issues that should be addressed or at least acknowledged in the notebook. The LFP data warning is particularly concerning as it suggests the data might be transposed incorrectly, which could lead to incorrect analysis.

Cell 12
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell introduces the examination of electrode information within the dataset, highlighting that recordings were taken from multiple brain regions. This prepares the reader for the subsequent analysis of electrode locations and properties.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 13
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell retrieves electrode information from the NWB file, counts the number of electrodes in each brain region, and then plots the distribution of electrodes across brain regions using a bar plot. This provides a visual representation of the electrode placement.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image shows a bar plot of the number of electrodes in each brain region. The x-axis represents the brain regions (e.g., dorsal anterior cingulate cortex left, pre supplementary motor area right, amygdala right, etc.), and the y-axis represents the count of electrodes. The height of each bar corresponds to the number of electrodes in that region. The plot title is "Number of Electrodes by Brain Region," and the axes are labeled appropriately. The x-axis labels are rotated to improve readability.

ISSUES:
None

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 16
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell introduces the visualization of LFP data from different brain regions.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 17
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell selects several brain regions, retrieves a 10-second sample of LFP data from one electrode within each of those regions, and plots the LFP data as a time series. Each subplot shows the LFP from a different brain region. The time axis goes from 0 to 10 seconds.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image contains a series of line plots, each displaying the LFP data from a different brain region over a 10-second period. The plots are arranged vertically. Each subplot is labeled with the brain region it represents (e.g., "LFP from hippocampus_left (electrode 22)"). The y-axis is labeled "Voltage (V)" and the x-axis is labeled "Time (s)" for the bottom subplot. The LFP data appears as fluctuating waveforms, with different brain regions exhibiting different patterns of activity.

ISSUES:
None

Cell 18
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell introduces an analysis of LFP activity during a specific trial, connecting neural activity to the task being performed.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 19
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell extracts trial information, selects a trial, and then plots the LFP data from a subset of brain regions during that trial. Vertical lines mark the start times of different phases of the trial (fixation cross, encoding, maintenance, probe, and response). The intent is to visualize how LFP activity changes during different stages of the working memory task. The cell prints the names of the columns in the NWB trials table. It also defines a function `time_to_sample` to convert timestamps into sample indices based on the LFP's sampling rate and starting time from the NWB file.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image contains four line plots, each showing the LFP data from a different brain region during a selected trial. The x-axis represents time in seconds (ranging from approximately 54 to 68 seconds), and the y-axis represents voltage. Each plot is labeled with the corresponding brain region (e.g., "LFP from hippocampus_left (electrode 22)"). Vertical lines with various colors and styles indicate the start times of different trial phases: "Trial Start" (black, dashed), "Encoding 1 Start" (green, dashed), "Encoding 1 End" (green, dotted), "Encoding 2 Start" (blue, dashed), "Encoding 2 End" (blue, dotted), "Encoding 3 Start" (cyan, dashed), "Encoding 3 End" (cyan, dotted), "Maintenance Start" (magenta, dashed), "Probe Start" (red, dashed), and "Response" (yellow, solid). A legend is included in the first subplot to identify the meaning of each vertical line.

ISSUES:
The main issue is the x-axis values seem incorrect. Looking at the plot it starts around 54s but the documentation indicates that the working memory task lasts ~10s. The trial start timestamp being used to calculate `trial_time_axis` appears incorrect and likely causing the x-axis timing to be off from the events. This will make it difficult to draw any valuable conclusions about the data. Additionally, the title "Time (s)" on x axis is vague, it should specify what 0 corresponds to. Also, there is the use of hardcoded `available_regions[:4]`, which assumes there are greater than 4 regions when that might not be the case. Consider dynamically checking for length.

Cell 20
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell introduces the time-frequency analysis, explaining its purpose in examining spectral content and oscillatory patterns in the LFP data. It sets the stage for the subsequent frequency analysis.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 21
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell performs time-frequency analysis on LFP data from the left hippocampus during a single trial. It first selects the region and an electrode within that region. Then, it calculates the spectrogram using `scipy.signal.spectrogram`. Finally, it plots both the raw LFP signal and the spectrogram, with vertical lines indicating key events during the trial. Horizontal lines highlight the theta and gamma frequency bands on the spectrogram. The time values on the x axis have also been adjusted.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image consists of two subplots arranged vertically. The top subplot displays the LFP signal from the left hippocampus (electrode 22) over time. The x-axis represents time in seconds, and the y-axis represents voltage. The vertical lines indicate the timing of different trial phases: "Trial Start", "Encoding 1", "Encoding 2", "Encoding 3", "Maintenance", "Probe", and "Response". The bottom subplot shows the spectrogram of the LFP data, with frequency (0-100 Hz) on the y-axis and time in seconds on the x-axis. The color intensity represents the power spectral density (dB/Hz). Horizontal dashed white lines indicate the boundaries of the theta (4-8 Hz) and gamma (30-100 Hz) frequency bands. Vertical lines (matching the colors and styles in the LFP plot above) again mark the timing of the different trial phases.

ISSUES:
Once again the x-axis is still wrong, and needs to be fixed in order for the spectrogram to be meaningful. A good check is to ensure the range of the trial phases seems reasonable with the experiment. There is the calculation of `t_adjusted`, it is doing `trial_time_axis[0] + nperseg/(2*fs)`, why does it need the axes be shifted like this? Also, the x axis on the spectrogram has vague title and should specify what 0 corresponds to.

Cell 22
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell is a brief introduction to single unit activity analysis in this dataset.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 23
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell retrieves the single unit data from the NWB file and stores it in a pandas DataFrame called `units_df`. It prints the number of units and the column names. It creates a new column in the `units_df` called 'location', which stores the brain region of each unit based on the associated electrode ID. It handles cases where electrode IDs are missing or invalid by assigning the location 'Unknown'. It seems to prioritize taking the single electrode if size is 1. Handling multiple electrodes might require further thought.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
The logic for dealing with multiple electrodes is not perfect. It simply takes the `first_electrode` if there are multiple. The notebook should consider *why* there are multiple electrodes and how best to represent that. Perhaps it means spikes are recorded across multiple electrodes? In that case, averaging their location might be helpful. Alternatively, the notebook could display the unit in all locations and give a count.

Cell 24
==========

OVERVIEW:
Introduces the concept of generating raster plots for visualizing the timing of individual unit spikes across trials.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 25
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell generates raster plots for a small number of units (up to 3) across 5 randomly sampled trials. For each unit, it plots the timing of spikes within each trial, normalizing the spike times to the start of the trial. Vertical lines indicate key events in the trials.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image contains three raster plots, stacked vertically. Each plot represents the spiking activity of a single neuron across five trials. The y-axis of each plot represents the trial number (0-4), and each dot on the plot indicates a spike. The location for all 3 units is displayed as `Unknown`. Vertical lines depict important trial events. However, the timestamps are not matching the spikes. The x axis is also negative.

ISSUES:
The raster plots have significant issues with timing. All three units are displaying location as `Unknown` which is problematic since the rest of the trials have been properly extracted. The scale on the x-axis is also incorrect making any temporal relationship impossible to ascertain. The events are not lining up with any spikes. It looks like an earlier trial and unit plotting has caused the issues.

Cell 26
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell introduces analysis of unit firing rates across trial phases.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 27
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell calculates the firing rates of a sample of units during different phases of the trials and generates a boxplot to visualize the firing rates for each phase, grouped by brain region. It defines trial phases with start and end timestamps. Note that it filters out trials where any of the phase timestamps are missing to ensure accurate analysis and also reduces the number of units.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image shows a boxplot of firing rates during different trial phases. The x-axis represents the trial phases ("Fixation", "Encoding 1", "Encoding 2", "Encoding 3", "Maintenance", "Probe"), and the y-axis represents the firing rate in Hz. The boxplots are grouped by "Brain Region", but it looks like all units could not find a valid electrode and just displays "Unknown". The legend is situated outside the plot on the right. Overall, it appears the probe phase had slightly elevated firing rate, but more analysis would be required to say more.

ISSUES:
Again all firing Rate is displaying for `Unknown` since all the units are not having electrodes matched. Because of this, the visualization is lacking any meaning. There is also some logic around the handling of potential errors and the "Unknown" conditions, so there would need to be careful testing of this code.

Cell 28
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell introduces the section on stimulus information, highlighting the visual stimuli presented during the experiment.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 29
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell loads stimulus image data from the NWB file. It prints the number of stimulus images and the shape for the first five images. Then, it displays the first four sample stimulus images using `matplotlib.pyplot.imshow`. It appears the images shown are photographs of famous people.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image displays four stimulus images. Each image is in RGB color with shape (400, 300, 3)
 arranged in a 2x2 grid. They are images of people that have been rotated +90 degrees clockwise. The images are titled "Image: image_101" through "Image: image_104".

ISSUES:
The images are rotated incorrectly. Their orientation is not along the axis of the face. This might be a simple fix, but it would be good for the presenter to fix this plot. It looks like rotating them 90 degrees counter clockwise may fix things. It is also worth noting that the loaded `stim_presentation` has not been used. It might be good to showcase where these images are used in a relevant trial, or what their relationship to the data is.

Cell 30
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell introduces the exploration of the stimulus presentation sequence within the task.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 31
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell plots the stimulus presentation sequence. It selects first 100 presented stimulus images and plots their index against time.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image displays a plot of the stimulus presentation sequence over time. The x-axis represents time in seconds, and the y-axis represents the image index. The plot shows how the image indices change over time, with data points connected by lines to highlight the sequence. Many of the data points are 0 or 225 so these specific images may be relevant.

ISSUES:
Can stim indices be floats? Even if they can, should they? The plot is also too granular. What information can be extracted from plotting every presentation? It could be aggregated by showing different stimulus presentations per trial.

Cell 32
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell introduces the analysis of the subject's behavioral performance in the working memory task.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 33
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell analyzes the subject's behavioral performance by calculating and plotting the accuracy on trials where the probe was in the encoding list ("in list"), trials where the probe was not in the encoding list ("out list"), and overall accuracy. It also calculates the percentage of "in list" and "out list" trials. The number of `in_list_trials` and `out_list_trials` are roughly the same (50% each).

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image shows a bar plot comparing "Overall" accuracy, "Probe In List" accuracy, and "Probe Not In List" accuracy. The y-axis represents the proportion of correct responses, ranging from 0 to 1.1. The "Overall" accuracy is 0.97, "Probe In List" accuracy is 0.94, and "Probe Not In List" accuracy is 1.00.

ISSUES:
The accuracies are extremely high. Also this part of the notebook does not appear to be broken (in contrast to several parts earlier). The plot would benefit from including error bars using confidence intervals or standard error to showcase how much the behavior varies.

Cell 34
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell summarizes the notebook's contents and outlines potential future research directions. It lists the types of data explored, key observations, and further analyses that could be conducted using the dataset. It also provides a reference to the associated GitHub repository.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
Because of all the issues related to broken code, many Key Observations may not be 100% accurate. The notebook mentions analysis across multiple subjects as a good next step, however the notebook failed to properly complete analysis within a single subject.
