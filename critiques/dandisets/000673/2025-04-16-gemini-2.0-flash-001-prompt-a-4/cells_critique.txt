Cell 3
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell provides an overview of Dandiset 000673. It restates the Dandiset's title and provides a brief summary of the study's objective, which is to understand the role of theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling in working memory. It also mentions the authors (Daume et al.) and a (likely incorrect) publication year of 2025. Finally, it provides a link to the Dandiset on Neurosift. The cell effectively introduces the dataset's content and its scientific context.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
The publication year "2025" is likely incorrect, as the notebook (and therefore this cell) was probably created before 2025. This should be checked and corrected. Also, the Neurosift link appears to be incorrect (it's linking to dandiset 001176/000673), and should be updated to the correct link for dandiset 000673.

Cell 4
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell outlines the structure and objectives of the notebook. It lays out a clear roadmap for the user, detailing the steps involved in exploring and analyzing the data from Dandiset 000673. These steps cover loading the Dandiset and NWB file, exploring metadata, visualizing relevant data such as LFP, events, and stimuli, and suggesting future directions. This cell acts as a guide for the user to understand the flow of the notebook.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
None


Cell 5
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell lists the Python packages required to execute the code in the notebook. It names `pynwb`, `h5py`, `remfile`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`. The cell advises the user to make sure these packages are installed in their environment before running the notebook. This ensures that the user can execute the code without encountering missing dependency errors.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
The list is missing `dandi`. The dandi API is mentioned in a later cell, so it should be added to this list.

Cell 6
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell introduces the use of the DANDI API for loading the Dandiset. It states that the subsequent code cell will connect to the DANDI archive and retrieve Dandiset "000673". This cell acts as an introduction to the code that will follow, explaining the purpose of using the DANDI API in this context.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
None

Cell 7
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell uses the `dandi` library to connect to the DANDI archive and retrieve Dandiset 000673. It initializes a `DandiAPIClient`, retrieves the Dandiset using its ID, and lists the assets (files) within the Dandiset. The code then prints the number of assets found and displays the paths of the first five assets. This cell successfully loads the Dandiset's metadata and provides a glimpse of its contents.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
None

Cell 8
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell specifies the NWB file that will be loaded: `sub-1/sub-1_ses-1_ecephys+image.nwb`. It also provides the URL for downloading this specific asset from the DANDI archive. The purpose is to introduce the user to a specific file within the Dandiset that will be used for further exploration and analysis. This cell sets the stage for loading and examining the NWB file's metadata in the subsequent cells.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
None


Cell 9
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell loads the specified NWB file from the provided URL using `pynwb`, `h5py`, and `remfile`. It then prints the NWB file object, session description, identifier, and session start time to display key metadata. It also output a warning about the dimension of the ElectricalSeries 'LFPs', which shows the user that they may need to transpose the `data` field when working with the data. This cell is crucial for accessing and understanding the basic information contained within the NWB file.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
The warning message "ElectricalSeries 'LFPs': The second dimension of data does not match the length of electrodes. Your data may be transposed" is important and should be highlighted in the markdown or in a comment. The user might not notice it otherwise. Also, the `file_create_date` is again in 2025, which is incorrect.

Cell 10
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell introduces the next phase of the notebook, focusing on loading and visualizing data from the NWB file. It specifically mentions that the focus will be on LFP data and that a segment of this data will be plotted. This cell serves to guide the user towards the practical data exploration aspect of the notebook.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
None

Cell 11
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell loads the LFP data from the NWB file, calculates the timestamps, and plots a 10-second segment of the LFP signal from the first channel. It uses `numpy` for numerical operations and `matplotlib` with `seaborn` for plotting. The plot displays the LFP signal over time, with appropriate axis labels and a title. This provides a basic visualization of the electrophysiological data contained within the NWB file.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image is a line plot showing LFP data over time. The x-axis represents time in seconds, ranging from 0 to 10. The y-axis represents LFP amplitude in volts, ranging from approximately -20 to 30. The plot shows a fluctuating LFP signal characteristic of neural activity. The title of the plot is "LFP Data from sub-1/sub-1_ses-1_ecephys+image.nwb". The plot is in the seaborn style, with a light grey background and gridlines.

ISSUES:
The warning in the previous cell indicated that the data may need to be transposed, but this cell assumes `lfp_data` is (time, channel). If that warning is correct, the plot shows data from all timepoints of a single channel. More appropriate would be to transpose `lfp_data` and then plot a few channels over a shorter amount of time, or just a single channel and verify that it looks reasonable. This is crucial for interpreting the LFP data correctly. The y-axis label "LFP (V)" should be more specific and reflect the units (e.g. "LFP (uV)").
The lfp_timestamps are recalculated instead of taking them directly from `nwb.acquisition["LFPs"].timestamps`.

Cell 12
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell introduces the next step in the analysis: visualizing event data from the NWB file. It sets the stage for the following code cell(s), indicating that they will focus on event-related data. This is a logical progression from visualizing the continuous LFP data.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
None

Cell 13
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell loads event timestamps and "data" from the NWB file and visualizes them using a stem plot. It plots the first 100 events, showing their occurrence times and corresponding "event type". The plot includes labels for the x and y axes ("Time (s)" and "Event Type," respectively) and a title indicating the source NWB file.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image is a stem plot of event data. The x-axis represents time in seconds, ranging from approximately 0 to 130. The y-axis represents the "Event Type," with values ranging from 0 to approximately 60. The plot shows vertical lines (stems) originating from the x-axis, with circles at the top, representing individual events. There is one very large event close to time 0. Most events have a value between approximately 2 and 12. The plot title is "Events from sub-1/sub-1_ses-1_ecephys+image.nwb".

ISSUES:
The label "Event Type" is ambiguous. The notebook does not describe what the values in `event_data` represent, making it difficult to interpret the plot. It is essential to understand what these "event types" signify in the context of the experiment to make the plot meaningful. If event_data represented event *codes*, then it would be better to either display the event codes on the y-axis (if there are few unique codes) or to create a new figure for each unique event code. If event_data contains continuous values, then a stem plot is likely not the most useful visualization.
The notebook plots the first 100 points, but the x axis extends beyond that, making the plot wider than necessary.

Cell 14
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell introduces the next step in the exploration: accessing stimulus presentation data from the NWB file. It signals that the following code will retrieve and potentially process information related to the stimuli presented during the experiment. This is a relevant step, given the study's focus on working memory tasks.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
None

Cell 15
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell accesses stimulus presentation data, including timestamps and stimulus indices, from the "StimulusPresentation" object in the NWB file. A stem plot visualizes the presentation times of the first 100 stimuli, with the y-axis representing the stimulus index. The graph is labeled appropriately with "Time (s)" on the x-axis and "Stimulus Index" on the y-axis.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image is a stem plot representing stimulus presentation data. The x-axis shows time in seconds, ranging from approximately 0 to 260. The y-axis, labeled "Stimulus Index," ranges from 0 to approximately 230. The plot shows the timing and the index of each presented stimulus.

ISSUES:
Like the event data, the meaning of the "Stimulus Index" is unclear. It would be more informative if the actual stimulus templates were displayed at the corresponding time, or if there was a legend associating the indices with specific stimulus types. Also, the notebook plots the first 100 points, but the x axis extends beyond that significantly making the plot wider than necessary.


Cell 16
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell summarizes the notebook's content, highlighting the steps taken to load the Dandiset, access NWB files, explore metadata, and visualize various data types. It then suggests potential avenues for further analysis, including advanced signal processing of LFP data, investigating relationships between LFP activity and events, detailed analysis of stimulus presentation data, and exploration of other NWB files within the Dandiset.
