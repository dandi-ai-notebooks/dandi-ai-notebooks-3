It iterates through each unit and extracts the electrode index. It then uses this index to look up the corresponding brain region ('location') in the `electrode_df`. However, the resulting bar plot shows that *all* units are labeled as \"unknown\". This is because the `electrode_idx` is an Electrode object rather than the electrode ID, and this is not used correctly to index the electrode location from the electrode dataframe.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe image is a bar plot titled \"Number of Units by Brain Region\". The x-axis represents the \"Brain Region\", with a single category labeled as \"unknown\". The y-axis represents the \"Number of Units\", and the single bar extends to a value of approximately 80.\n\nISSUES:\nThe code fails to correctly map units to brain regions. The resulting bar plot shows all units are labeled as \"unknown\". This strongly suggests an error in how the 'electrodes' column of the `units_df` is being used to index into the `electrode_df`. The code needs to be revised to properly extract and use the electrode IDs. The issue is that electrode_idx is an Electrode object instead of an Id integer.",
