    "OVERVIEW: This cell provides an introduction to the notebook. It describes the Dandiset being explored (000673), summarizes the research question it addresses, and outlines the notebook's objectives: loading the Dandiset, accessing metadata and LFP data, and visualizing stimulus templates. It also lists the required Python packages. The cell serves as a high-level guide for the user.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: None\n",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell establishes a connection to the DANDI Archive using the `dandiapi` client, retrieves Dandiset 000673, and lists the assets (files) within the Dandiset. The code iterates through the assets and prints the paths of the first five files. This cell helps the user to verify access to the Dandiset and get familiar with the available files.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: None\n",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell introduces the next step: loading metadata of a specific NWB file (`sub-1/sub-1_ses-1_ecephys+image.nwb`) from the Dandiset. It prepares the user for the subsequent code that will perform this task.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: None",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell loads the NWB file specified in the previous cell using `pynwb`, `h5py`, and `remfile`. It defines the URL for the remote file, opens it using `remfile`, and then uses `pynwb` to read the NWB file into a variable called `nwb`. Finally, it prints the `nwb` object, displaying its metadata, which includes information about the acquisition, devices, electrodes, experiment details, subject, trials, and units. The warnings about namespace versions can be ignored, as they do not affect the functionality. The warning about the ElectricalSeries \"LFPs\" may indicate that the data is transposed; it is important to remember this for any subsequent analysis.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: The warning about the data potentially being transposed needs to be visible in the output. The notebook or a follow-on cell should contain information on how to resolve it.",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell introduces examples of how to access specific metadata within the loaded NWB file. It prepares the user for the following code snippets that demonstrate this.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: None\n",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell demonstrates how to access specific metadata attributes from the loaded NWB file. It retrieves and displays the session description, identifier, and session start time. This allows the user to see concrete examples of how to access metadata within the NWB file object.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: None\n",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell introduces the next step in the notebook: loading and visualizing LFP (Local Field Potential) data from the NWB file. It prepares the user for the code that follows.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: None",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell extracts LFP data from the NWB file and visualizes the first 10 seconds of data from the first five channels. It accesses the LFP data and sampling rate, generates a time vector, and then iterates through the first five channels, plotting the LFP signal against time for each channel. Each plot displays the time series data for a single LFP channel. The plots are displayed directly in the notebook.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: The output consists of five line plots, each showing LFP data for a different channel over time. Each plot has \"Time (s)\" on the x-axis, ranging from 0 to 10 seconds, and \"LFP (volts)\" on the y-axis. The y-axis range varies slightly between plots but generally spans from approximately -20 to +40 volts. Each plot displays a noisy, fluctuating LFP signal, characteristic of neural recordings. The plots are titled \"LFP Data - Channel {i}\", where i ranges from 0 to 4, corresponding to the channel number. Each plot is clear and well-labeled, effectively illustrating the LFP signal for the selected channels.\n\nISSUES: The `num_channels` variable is determined from the shape of the lfp_data via `shape[1]` which assumes time is the first axis. However, the warning produced when loading the NWB file in a previous cell indicates that data may be transposed. If it is transposed, then `shape[0]` should be used. This could mean either that `num_channels` is incorrectly calculated, or more seriously that it's plotting channels as if they are time and only showing a subset of the duration. This is a potentially serious issue. Suggest using the `ElectricalSeries.data.dims` attribute to access the dimension labels/names. The code currently only accesses the first 10 seconds. It should adjust the y-axis to show the full range of lfp_data[0:num_timepoints, i] by calling `plt.ylim()` appropriately.",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell contains a statement describing the previous cell's output. It simply states that the plots display LFP data for the first 5 channels.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: None",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell introduces the next section of the notebook, which will focus on loading and visualizing stimulus template images stored in the NWB file.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: None",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell extracts and displays stimulus template images from the NWB file. It accesses the `stimulus_template` field, retrieves the image data, and then iterates through the first five images, displaying each one with its corresponding key as the title. The axes are turned off for cleaner visualization.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: The output consists of five images, each a color photograph of a person's face, presented at an angle. The images are labeled with titles such as \"Stimulus Template - image_101\", \"Stimulus Template - image_102\" etc. The faces appear discernible, though all are rotated counter-clockwise by about 45 degrees.\n\nISSUES: The images are rotated 45 degrees counter clockwise. This is not correct. The notebook should ideally correct for the rotation. The rotation is not mentioned anywhere in the notebook, and is a serious flaw.",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell describes the output of the previous cell, correctly stating that it displays the first five stimulus template images.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: None",
    "OVERVIEW: This cell summarizes the notebook's accomplishments, highlighting the loading and visualization of LFP data and stimulus template images. It also suggests potential avenues for further analysis, such as examining the correlation between LFP and stimulus, spike sorting, exploring phase-amplitude coupling, and analyzing neural activity during the Sternberg task.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS: None\n\nISSUES: None"
