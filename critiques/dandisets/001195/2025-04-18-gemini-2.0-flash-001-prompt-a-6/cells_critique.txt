Cell 1
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell introduces the notebook, providing its title, acknowledging its AI-generated nature, and stating its purpose: to demonstrate how to explore and analyze data from Dandiset 001195. It summarizes the content of the Dandiset, outlines the notebook's structure, lists required packages, and explains how to load the Dandiset metadata. The cell effectively sets the stage for the subsequent analysis.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None


Cell 2
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell uses the `dandi.dandiapi` library to connect to the DANDI Archive, retrieve Dandiset 001195, and display its name, URL, and a list of the first 5 assets along with the total number of assets in the Dandiset. This cell successfully loads and interacts with the DANDI API.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 3
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell introduces the next section of the notebook, which focuses on loading and visualizing electrophysiology data from a specific NWB file within the Dandiset. It clearly states the file that will be used for the demonstration.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 4
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell loads the necessary libraries, specifies the URL for a particular NWB file asset, and loads the NWB file using `remfile`, `h5py`, and `pynwb`. The use of seaborn is also included to improve plot aesthetics.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None


Cell 5
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell explains how the loaded NWB file will be explored. It refers to the `nwb-file-info` output (presumably from a prior analysis or an external source), noting that the file contains both current clamp and voltage clamp data and that the notebook will begin by visualizing current clamp data. It then describes where the data is stored in the NWB file (`nwb.acquisition`).

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None


Cell 6
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell prints the keys of the `nwb.acquisition` dictionary. This reveals the names of the different acquisition objects stored in the NWB file, which include current clamp and voltage clamp data. This is a useful step for understanding the structure of the data.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None


Cell 7
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell selects a specific current clamp response (`current_clamp-response-01-ch-0`) from the available keys in the `nwb.acquisition` dictionary for loading and plotting. It prepares for the visualization of this specific dataset.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 8
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell extracts the data and sampling rate from the specified current clamp response object. It then generates a time vector using the sampling rate and plots the voltage data against time. The plot is labeled appropriately with axis labels and a title.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image is a line plot showing the voltage response over time in a current clamp experiment. The x-axis represents time in seconds, ranging from approximately 0 to 0.3 seconds. The y-axis represents voltage in volts, ranging from approximately -3200 to -2200. The plot shows an initial voltage level around -2300 V. Around 0.1 seconds, the voltage rapidly decreases to approximately -3200 V, and then recovers/increases gradually until about 0.3 seconds, ending around -2200V. The title of the plot is "Current Clamp Response." The plot uses seaborn styling with a light background and gridlines.

ISSUES:
None


Cell 9
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell transitions to loading and plotting the stimulus data associated with the electrophysiology recordings. It identifies that the stimulus data is stored in the `nwb.stimulus` dictionary and prepares to examine its contents.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 10
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell prints the keys of the `nwb.stimulus` dictionary, revealing the names of the stimulus objects stored in the NWB file. Similar to the previous cell displaying the acquisition keys, this helps the user understand the structure of the data and select a stimulus for visualization.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 11
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell selects `stimulus-01-ch-0` from the `nwb.stimulus` dictionary for loading and visualization.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None

Cell 12
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell extracts the stimulus data and sampling rate from the specified current clamp stimulus object. It then generates a time vector and plots the current data against time, labeling the plot with axis labels and a title.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image is a line plot depicting the current stimulus over time in a current clamp experiment. The x-axis represents time in seconds, spanning from 0 to 0.3 seconds. The y-axis represents current in Amperes (A), ranging from approximately -120 to 0. The plot shows an initial current level of 0 A until approximately 0.1 seconds. At 0.1 seconds, the current abruptly drops to -120 A and remains at that level until about 0.2 seconds. After 0.2 seconds, the current returns to 0 A and stays there until the end of the plotted time window. The title of the plot is "Current Clamp Stimulus". The plot uses seaborn styling with light background and gridlines. The plot clearly illustrates a square-pulse stimulus.

ISSUES:
None

Cell 13
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell summarizes the actions performed in the notebook: loading Dandiset metadata, listing assets, loading an NWB file, and visualizing electrophysiology data. It also suggests possible future directions for analysis, such as exploring other NWB files, visualizing different data types, and performing more advanced analysis of the electrophysiology data. This provides a useful conclusion and suggestions for further exploration.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None

ISSUES:
None
