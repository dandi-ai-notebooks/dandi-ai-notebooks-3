    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell uses the `dandi` library to connect to the DANDI Archive and retrieve the specified Dandiset (001195). It then extracts and prints the Dandiset's name and URL from its metadata. Finally, it lists the first five assets (files) contained within the Dandiset.

    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell retrieves and plots voltage and current data from the NWB file. It first selects a specific current clamp response and its corresponding stimulus by name. If found, it prints their descriptions, starting time, sampling rate and data shape. Then, it loads a one-second subset of the voltage and current data. It converts both to their actual units and plots the voltage response and current stimulus as a function of time. The plot displays the voltage (in volts) in response to the injected current (in picoamperes).\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe image contains two subplots displayed vertically. The top subplot shows the voltage response of a neuron over time, plotted in blue. The x-axis represents time in seconds (from 0 to 1), and the y-axis represents voltage in volts (ranging from approximately -0.095 to -0.060). The plot shows an initial stable voltage that rapidly decreases upon stimulation, followed by fluctuations.\n\nThe bottom subplot shows the corresponding current stimulus over the same time period, plotted in red. The x-axis is again time in seconds (from 0 to 1), and the y-axis represents current in picoamperes (ranging from -120 to 0). The current stimulus is a step function, with a value of 0 pA for the first ~0.2 seconds, and then a constant -120 pA stimulus from ~0.2 to 1 second.\n\nBoth subplots share the same x-axis.

    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell generates and plots the I-V relationship. It iterates through current clamp responses and stimulus intensities (from \"current_clamp-response-02-ch-0\" to \"current_clamp-response-09-ch-0\"). It extracts the steady-state voltage and corresponding current by averaging the data in the middle of each trace.

The x-axis represents the injected current in picoamperes (pA), ranging from approximately -120 to 20. The y-axis represents the membrane potential in volts (V), ranging from approximately -0.085 to -0.055. The plot shows a fairly linear relationship between the injected current and the membrane potential. Blue scatter points and connected lines represent measurements; as the current is injected, the membrane potential depolarizes (becomes less negative).\n\nISSUES:\nNone",

    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell analyzes and visualizes a single action potential waveform. It extracts a 7ms window around the first detected spike (2ms before, 5ms after).

    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell constructs and plots an F-I curve. It iterates through different current clamp responses and stimulus intensities from \"current_clamp-response-02-ch-0\" to \"current_clamp-response-29-ch-0\". For each stimulus-response pair, it calculates the mean stimulus current and counts the number of spikes during the stimulus period (0.5-1.5s), using the peak finding method for spike detection. The firing frequency is then calculated as the number of spikes per second. Finally, it plots the firing frequency as a function of the injected current, creating the F-I curve.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe image displays a plot of the frequency-current (F-I) relationship. The x-axis represents the injected current in picoamperes (pA), ranging from approximately -40 to 90. The y-axis represents the firing frequency in Hertz (Hz), ranging from 0 to 350. The plot shows a curve with a relatively flat initial section, followed by a steep increase in firing frequency at a certain threshold of injected current (around 70 pA), and subsequently flattens.\n\nISSUES:\nNone",

It plots the fluorescence traces for the first five ROIs over the first two minutes of the recording.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe image shows a plot of fluorescence traces for five selected regions of interest (ROIs) over time. The x-axis represents time in seconds, ranging from 0 to 120. The y-axis represents fluorescence in arbitrary units (a.u.), ranging from approximately -0.7 to 0.7.

    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell calculates and displays basic statistics for the calcium imaging data. It iterates through 30 ROIs and calculates the mean, standard deviation, maximum, and minimum fluorescence activity for each. Using `scipy.signal.find_peaks`, it also calculates the event rate of calcium transients for each ROI based on a Z-score normalized trace, with a minimum distance of 0.5 seconds between peaks. It stores these statistics in a Pandas DataFrame and diplays it. Finally, it plots a histogram showing the distribution of calcium event rates across the ROIs.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe image is a histogram showing the distribution of calcium event rates across regions of interest (ROIs). The x-axis represents the event rate in Hertz (Hz), ranging from Approximately 0.03 to 0.12. The y-axis represents the number of ROIs, ranging from 0 to 4.
