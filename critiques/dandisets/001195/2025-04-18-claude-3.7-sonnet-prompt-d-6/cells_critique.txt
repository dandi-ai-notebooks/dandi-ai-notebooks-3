Cell 11
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell retrieves and plots voltage and current data from the NWB file. It first selects a specific current clamp response and its corresponding stimulus by name. If found, it prints their descriptions, starting time, sampling rate and data shape. Then, it loads a one-second subset of the voltage and current data. It converts both to their actual units and plots the voltage response and current stimulus as a function of time. The plot displays the voltage (in volts) in response to the injected current (in picoamperes).

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image contains two subplots displayed vertically. The top subplot shows the voltage response of a neuron over time, plotted in blue. The x-axis represents time in seconds (from 0 to 1), and the y-axis represents voltage in volts (ranging from approximately -0.095 to -0.060). The plot shows an initial stable voltage that rapidly decreases upon stimulation, followed by fluctuations.

The bottom subplot shows the corresponding current stimulus over the same time period, plotted in red. The x-axis is again time in seconds (from 0 to 1), and the y-axis represents current in picoamperes (ranging from -120 to 0). The current stimulus is a step function, with a value of 0 pA for the first ~0.2 seconds, and then a constant -120 pA stimulus from ~0.2 to 1 second.

Both subplots share the same x-axis. The titles of the subplots provide descriptions of the voltage response and current stimulus.

Cell 13
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell generates and plots the I-V relationship. It iterates through current clamp responses and stimulus intensities (from "current_clamp-response-02-ch-0" to "current_clamp-response-09-ch-0"). It extracts the steady-state voltage and corresponding current by averaging the data in the middle of each trace. These values are then plotted with injected current on the x-axis and membrane potential on the y-axis, showing the I-V relationship for the neuron.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image displays an I-V relationship plot. The x-axis represents the injected current in picoamperes (pA), ranging from approximately -120 to 20. The y-axis represents the membrane potential in volts (V), ranging from approximately -0.085 to -0.055. The plot shows a fairly linear relationship between the injected current and the membrane potential. Blue scatter points and connected lines represent measurements; as the current is injected, the membrane potential depolarizes (becomes less negative).

OVERVIEW:
This cell attempts to detect and visualize action potentials in response to a strong current injection. It loads a response series and its corresponding stimulus. A simple threshold-based approach, improved by using `scipy.signal.find_peaks`, is used to detect putative action potentials. Finally, the entire voltage trace is plotted, highlighting detected action potentials with red dots. The estimated resting potential is calculated at the beginning of the cell for reference.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image displays a plot of voltage over time, showing action potentials detected in response to current injection. The x-axis represents time in seconds, ranging from 0 to 5. The y-axis represents voltage in volts, ranging from approximately -0.07 to 0.04. A blue line shows the voltage trace, and red circles indicate the detected action potential peaks. A pink dashed horizontal line represents the voltage threshold at -0.02 V. The title indicates that action potentials are plotted in response to a 75 pA current injection, and the plot includes a legend for the threshold line. The action potentials occur primarily during the first second. After the first second, the cell hyperpolarizes and fluctuates slightly around -0.06V.

OVERVIEW:
This cell analyzes and visualizes a single action potential waveform. It extracts a 7ms window around the first detected spike (2ms before, 5ms after). It calculates several action potential properties: amplitude, half-width, and maximum upstroke. Finally, it plots the extracted action potential, marking the peak with a red dot and indicating the half-width with a green line and annotation if the half-width calculation was successful.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image is a plot of a single action potential waveform. The x-axis represents time in milliseconds, ranging from approximately 186.5 to 193.5. The y-axis represents voltage in millivolts, ranging from approximately -45 to 35. A blue line shows the action potential waveform. A red circle marks the peak of the action potential, at approximately 30 mV. A green horizontal line at approximately -10 mV indicates the duration for calculating the half-width, labeled with an arrow and text "Half-width: 1.20 ms".

Cell 19
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell constructs and plots an F-I curve. It iterates through different current clamp responses and stimulus intensities from "current_clamp-response-02-ch-0" to "current_clamp-response-29-ch-0". For each stimulus-response pair, it calculates the mean stimulus current and counts the number of spikes during the stimulus period (0.5-1.5s), using the peak finding method for spike detection. The firing frequency is then calculated as the number of spikes per second. Finally, it plots the firing frequency as a function of the injected current, creating the F-I curve.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image displays a plot of the frequency-current (F-I) relationship. The x-axis represents the injected current in picoamperes (pA), ranging from approximately -40 to 90. The y-axis represents the firing frequency in Hertz (Hz), ranging from 0 to 350. The plot shows a curve with a relatively flat initial section, followed by a steep increase in firing frequency at a certain threshold of injected current (around 70 pA), and subsequently flattens.

OVERVIEW:
This cell generates a heatmap to visualize calcium activity patterns across 20 ROIs over the first two minutes of recording. The data is extracted similarly to the previous cell. The `imshow` function is used to display the fluorescence values as a heatmap, with the colormap set to 'viridis'. The xlabel and time tick labels are modified to show the time in seconds.

The x-axis represents time in seconds, ranging from 0 to 120, with each tick labeled in 30-second intervals. The y-axis represents the ROI number, ranging from 0 to 19. The color intensity indicates the fluorescence level in arbitrary units via a colorbar on the right of the heatmap, ranging from approximately -1 to 3. Higher fluorescence levels are represented by brighter colors (yellow/green), while lower levels are represented by darker colors (blue/purple). There are some ROIs (last few) at the bottom of the image, which show greater fluorescence than other ROIs at certain timepoints such as ~25s.

OVERVIEW:
This cell calculates and displays basic statistics for the calcium imaging data. It iterates through 30 ROIs and calculates the mean, standard deviation, maximum, and minimum fluorescence activity for each. Using `scipy.signal.find_peaks`, it also calculates the event rate of calcium transients for each ROI based on a Z-score normalized trace, with a minimum distance of 0.5 seconds between peaks. It stores these statistics in a Pandas DataFrame and diplays it. Finally, it plots a histogram showing the distribution of calcium event rates across the ROIs.

IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image is a histogram showing the distribution of calcium event rates across regions of interest (ROIs). The x-axis represents the event rate in Hertz (Hz), ranging from Approximately 0.03 to 0.12. The y-axis represents the number of ROIs, ranging from 0 to 4. The histogram shows the counts in 15 bins using light-blue bars with black outlines. The distribution appears somewhat multi-modal, but with prominent bins near 0.08Hz.
