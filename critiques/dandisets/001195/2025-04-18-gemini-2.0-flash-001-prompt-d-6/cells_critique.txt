IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
None


Cell 3
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell provides an overview of the Dandiset being explored (dandiset 001195) and its corresponding publication. It also describes the types of data included in the Dandiset (calcium imaging, behavioral videos, electrophysiology) and provides a link to the Dandiset on the DANDI Archive. This cell serves as a helpful introduction to the notebook's subject matter.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
None

Cell 4
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell outlines the structure and content of the notebook, providing a roadmap for the user. It lists the key steps involved in exploring the Dandiset, including loading data, visualizing different modalities (electrophysiology and histology), and suggesting future analysis.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
None

Cell 5
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell lists the necessary Python packages for running the notebook. This is useful for the user to ensure they have the correct dependencies installed before running the code.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
None

Cell 6
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell imports the necessary Python libraries for interacting with the DANDI Archive, handling NWB files, and visualizing data. The libraries imported are `DandiAPIClient`, `pynwb`, `h5py`, `remfile`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, and `numpy`.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
None

Cell 7
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell introduces the section of the notebook where the Dandiset will be loaded. It serves as a heading to organize the content.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
None

Cell 8
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell connects to the DANDI archive, retrieves the specified Dandiset (001195), and prints some basic information, including the Dandiset name, URL, and a list of the first 5 assets within the Dandiset. This cell helps the user confirm that the Dandiset has been loaded correctly and provides an overview of the available data.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
None

Cell 9
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell indicates which specific NWB file will be loaded from the Dandiset. It provides the file path and a direct download URL, which is useful for accessing the data independently or for verification purposes.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
None

Cell 10
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell loads the NWB file identified in the previous cell using the provided URL. It uses `remfile` and `h5py` to access the remote file, and `pynwb` to read the NWB file content. It then prints the session description, identifier, and session start time from the NWB file. This cell confirms that the NWB file was successfully loaded and allows the user to inspect basic metadata.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
None

Cell 11
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell introduces the section focused on loading and visualizing electrophysiology data from the previously loaded NWB file. It serves as a heading for the following code.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
None

Cell 12
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell extracts current clamp data from the NWB file and visualizes it using matplotlib. The plot shows the voltage (in mV) over time (in samples). The plot is titled "Current Clamp Response 01 ch 0", and the axes are labeled appropriately.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The plot shows a time series of voltage measurements. Initially, the voltage fluctuates around -2300 mV. Around sample 800, there is a rapid increase in voltage reaching approximately -2260 mV by the end of 1000 samples. The plot clearly shows a response in the voltage trace, possibly to a current injection.
ISSUES:
None

Cell 13
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell introduces the next major section of the notebook, which focuses on loading and visualizing histology images, if available in the Dandiset and the selected NWB file.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
None

Cell 14
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell attempts to load and display histology images from the NWB file. It retrieves the "histology_images" data interface and, if images are present, iterates through them, displaying the first image found using `plt.imshow` with a grayscale colormap. It also prints the name of the image being plotted. If no images are found, it prints a message indicating that. The `break` statement ensures that only the first image is displayed.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
The image is a grayscale histology image, labeled "Histology Image 1". It shows a section of tissue with varying levels of brightness. There is a bright, somewhat oval, area in the lower center of the image, surrounded by darker regions with more diffuse features. Faint line-like structures can be observed in the upper portion of the image.
ISSUES:
None

Cell 15
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell summarizes the steps performed in the notebook, highlighting the loading and visualization of electrophysiology and histology data. It also suggests potential future analysis directions, such as spike detection/sorting, correlating behavior with neural activity, and comparing data across Dandisets. This cell provides closure to the notebook and offers suggestions for further exploration.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
None
