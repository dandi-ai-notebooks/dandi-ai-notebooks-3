    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell is an introductory markdown cell. It provides the title of the notebook, a warning about the AI-generated nature of the notebook, a brief overview of the Dandiset 001195 and its associated publication, and a summary of the notebook's contents. It provides a link to the Dandiset on the DANDI Archive.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell lists the Python packages required to run the notebook.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell is a heading indicating the next section of the notebook will cover loading the Dandiset.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell uses the `dandi` package to connect to the DANDI archive, retrieve Dandiset 001195, and print basic information about the Dandiset, including its name, URL, the number of assets, and a list of the first 5 asset file paths.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis markdown cell introduces the next step, which is to load an NWB file from the Dandiset to explore its content. It provides a URL for a specific NWB file.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell loads the NWB file specified in the previous cell using `pynwb`, `h5py`, and `remfile`. Instead of downloading the file entirely, it efficiently accesses it remotely. It extracts and prints key metadata information from the NWB file, including the session description, identifier, session start time, and experimenter. This helps the user understand the basic experimental context of the loaded data.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis markdown cell introduces the visualization of current clamp response data from the loaded NWB file.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell generates a plot of the current clamp response data from the loaded NWB file. It extracts the data and sampling rate from the `nwb` object, calculates the timestamps, and uses `matplotlib` to create a plot of voltage against time. The plot includes labels for the axes, a title, a legend, and a grid for readability.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe image is a plot of \"Current Clamp Response\" data. The x-axis shows \"Time (s)\" ranging from 0 to 0.3. The y-axis shows \"Voltage (V)\" ranging from approximately -3200 to -2200. There is a single blue line representing the \"Current Clamp Response - Channel 0\". The plot shows a relatively stable voltage level around -2300 until about 0.1 seconds, where there's a sharp drop to around -3200. This lower voltage level is maintained until about 0.2 seconds, after which the voltage gradually returns towards the initial level. A grid is present in the background to aid in reading values.\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell provides a conclusion to the notebook, summarizing the value of the dataset and suggesting potential directions for future analysis, such as exploring other data types within the dataset (behavior videos and calcium imaging data).\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone"
