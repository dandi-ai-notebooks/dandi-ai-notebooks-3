    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell provides the title of the Jupyter notebook, which is \"Exploring Dandiset 001195: Separable Dorsal Raphe Dopamine Projections Mediate the Facets of Loneliness-like State.\" It sets the stage for the subsequent analysis and indicates the specific Dandiset that will be explored.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell presents a disclaimer stating that the notebook was AI-generated and has not been fully verified. It warns the reader to use caution when interpreting the code and results. This is important because it acknowledges the potential for errors or inaccuracies and encourages critical evaluation of the notebook's content.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell provides an overview of the Dandiset being explored in the notebook. It specifies the DANDI archive ID (001195), the title of the associated publication, and the authors. It also provides a direct link to the Dandiset on the DANDI archive. This cell effectively introduces the context and source of the data that will be analyzed.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell outlines the structure and content that will be covered in the notebook. It lists the key steps: loading metadata, listing assets, and loading and visualizing data from an NWB file. This provides a clear roadmap for the reader.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell lists the Python packages required to execute the code in the notebook. It explicitly states that these packages are assumed to be pre-installed, avoiding the inclusion of `pip install` commands, which is good practice for reproducibility when specific environment setups are expected.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell uses the `dandi` package to connect to the DANDI archive, retrieve Dandiset 001195, and extract metadata. It prints the Dandiset name and URL. It also lists the first 5 assets (files) within the Dandiset. This cell successfully demonstrates how to access and explore a Dandiset's contents.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the section where an example NWB file will be loaded and visualized. It specifies the target file name and provides the direct download URL for the asset. This prepares the reader for the data loading and visualization steps that will follow.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell loads the NWB file specified in the previous cell using `pynwb`, `h5py`, and `remfile`. It then prints the session description, experimenter, and subject ID from the NWB file's metadata. This successfully demonstrates how to access and retrieve metadata from an NWB file stored on the DANDI archive via its URL using `remfile`.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the section where the current clamp response data from the loaded NWB file will be visualized. This prepares the reader for the specific data visualization that will follow.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell extracts the current clamp response data and corresponding timestamps from the loaded NWB file. It plots the voltage data against time. The plot is labeled with appropriate axis titles and a title. It handles the case where timestamps are not explicitly available by computing them using the sampling rate.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe plot shows a time series of voltage data. The x-axis represents time in seconds, ranging from approximately 0 to 0.3 seconds. The y-axis represents voltage in volts, ranging from approximately -3200 to -2200. The plot shows a relatively stable voltage level, then a sudden drop in voltage around 0.1 seconds, followed by a gradual recovery back towards the initial level, ending around 0.3 seconds. This is representative of a typical current clamp response to a stimulus.\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell summarizes the key steps covered in the notebook: loading metadata, listing assets, and visualizing data. It also suggests potential future directions for analysis, such as exploring more files, analyzing electrophysiology data, and correlating neuronal activity with behavior. This provides a conclusion to the notebook and motivates further investigation.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone"
