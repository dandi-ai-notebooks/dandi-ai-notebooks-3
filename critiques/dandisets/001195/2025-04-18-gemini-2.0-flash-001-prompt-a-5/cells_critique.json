    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell contains the title of the Jupyter notebook. It introduces the specific Dandiset (001195) that will be explored and provides a concise description of the research topic covered in the Dandiset. This cell serves as the introductory element, setting the context for the subsequent analysis and exploration of the data.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell contains a warning indicating that the notebook was AI-generated and should be used with caution. It emphasizes that the content hasn't been fully verified and that interpretations of code and results should be done carefully. This disclaimer is crucial for managing user expectations and highlighting the need for critical evaluation of the notebook's content.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell provides an overview of the Dandiset (001195) and the notebook itself. It summarizes the content of the Dandiset, highlighting the presence of in vivo calcium imaging, behavioral videos, and ex vivo patch-clamp electrophysiology recordings, and mentions the associated publication. It also provides a direct link to the Dandiset on Neurosift, allowing users to explore the data interactively. Finally, it states the focus of the notebook on electrophysiology recordings.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell lists the Python packages required to execute the code within the notebook. It explicitly names `pynwb`, `h5py`, `remfile`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`. This is critical for ensuring reproducibility and informing users about the necessary dependencies before they attempt to run the notebook.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone\n",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell uses the `dandi` library to connect to the DANDI archive and retrieve the Dandiset with ID \"001195\". It then lists the assets contained within the Dandiset. The code retrieves the Dandiset's assets and prints the number of assets found, followed by the paths of the first five assets. This is a good initial step for programmatically exploring the contents of the Dandiset.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell prepares the user to load and explore a specific NWB file from the Dandiset. It provides the relative path to the NWB file within the Dandiset's structure and then provides the direct URL for downloading this specific asset. This is a necessary step towards accessing and working with the data contained in the file.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell loads the NWB file specified in the previous cell using `pynwb`, `h5py`, and `remfile`. It constructs a `remfile.File` object from the URL, opens it using `h5py`, and then reads the NWB file using `pynwb.NWBHDF5IO`. Finally, it prints the `session_description`, `identifier`, and `session_start_time` attributes of the loaded NWB file. This demonstrates how to access basic metadata from the NWB file.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell sets the intention to load and visualize specific data, `current_clamp-response-01-ch-0`, from the previously loaded NWB file. It acts as a transition, indicating the next step in the data exploration process.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell loads the `current_clamp-response-01-ch-0` data, its `starting_time`, and `rate` from the NWB file. It then generates timestamps based on the `starting_time` and `rate`, and plots the voltage data against time using Matplotlib and Seaborn. The plot is labeled with appropriate axes labels and a title. The purpose is to visualize the electrophysiology data extracted from the NWB file.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe image is a plot of voltage (V) over time (s) for the \"current_clamp-response-01-ch-0\" data. The x-axis represents time, ranging from approximately 0.0 to 0.3 seconds. The y-axis represents voltage, ranging from approximately -3200 to -2200 V. The plot shows a relatively stable voltage level initially, followed by a sharp downward deflection at approximately 0.1 seconds, reaching a minimum around -3200 V. The voltage then recovers slowly back toward the initial level, showing a curved return to baseline. The plot's title is \"Current Clamp Response - Channel 0\".\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell introduces the next step: plotting the stimulus that was applied during the electrophysiology recording, complementing the previous plot of the resulting voltage response. This indicates a move towards exploring the relationship between the stimulus and the recorded response.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell loads the stimulus data (`stimulus-01-ch-0`), its `starting_time`, and `rate` from the NWB file. Timestamps for the stimulus are generated and plotted against the stimulus current. The plot visualizes the current clamp stimulus over time, allowing comparison with the voltage response shown in the previous cell. Appropriate axes labels and a title are included.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nThe image is a plot of current (A) over time (s) representing the current clamp stimulus. The x-axis represents time, ranging from approximately 0 to 0.3 seconds. The y-axis represents current, ranging from approximately -120 to 0 A. The plot shows a baseline current of 0 A until approximately 0.1 seconds, at which point there is a sharp downward step to approximately -120 A. The current remains at this level until approximately 0.2 seconds, and then sharply returns to 0 A. The plot is titled \"Current Clamp Stimulus - Channel 0\".\n\nISSUES:\nNone",
    "OVERVIEW:\nThis cell summarizes the key steps demonstrated in the notebook: loading a Dandiset, loading an NWB file, and visualizing electrophysiology data. It also suggests future directions for analysis, such as analyzing other electrophysiology data types (voltage clamp), exploring stimulus-response relationships, and examining calcium imaging and behavioral data available in the Dandiset. This provides a good conclusion and encourages further exploration of the dataset.\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:\nNone\n\nISSUES:\nNone"
