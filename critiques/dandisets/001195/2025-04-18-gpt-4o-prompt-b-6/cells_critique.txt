Cell 1
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell contains the title of the notebook, which introduces the specific Dandiset (001195) that the notebook will explore. The title also provides a brief description of the scientific study behind the Dandiset, indicating that it investigates the neural basis of loneliness using dopamine projections in the dorsal raphe.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
None


Cell 2
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell presents a disclaimer, clearly stating that the notebook was automatically generated and hasn't been fully verified by a human. It warns the user to be careful when interpreting the code and results.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
None

Cell 3
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell provides an overview of the Dandiset being analyzed and outlines the contents of the notebook. It gives a brief summary of the scientific study, provides a link to the Dandiset in the DANDI Archive, and lists the key steps the notebook will cover: loading the Dandiset, visualizing current clamp responses, and analyzing stimulus series.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
None

Cell 4
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell lists the necessary Python packages for running the code in the notebook: `pynwb`, `h5py`, `matplotlib`, `remfile`, and `dandi`. This allows the user to ensure they have the correct dependencies installed before proceeding.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
None

Cell 5
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell establishes a connection to the DANDI Archive, retrieves Dandiset 001195, and extracts basic information about it. It imports necessary libraries, initializes the DandiAPIClient, retrieves the Dandiset metadata (name and URL), and lists the first five assets (NWB files) within the Dandiset. This cell serves as the entry point for accessing and exploring the Dandiset's contents.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
None

Cell 6
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell introduces the process of loading an NWB (Neurodata Without Borders) file, which is the data format used in the Dandiset. It serves as a transition to the subsequent code cell that will demonstrate how to load a specific NWB file from the Dandiset.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
None

Cell 7
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell demonstrates how to load a specific NWB file from the DANDI Archive using the `remfile` and `pynwb` libraries. It constructs a URL for a specific asset, opens the file using `remfile` and `h5py`, reads the NWB file using `pynwb`, and then prints the session description and experimenter information from the NWB file.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
None

Cell 8
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell focuses on visualizing the current clamp response and stimulus series data from the loaded NWB file. It retrieves the relevant data streams from the `nwb` object, creates a time axis, converts the data to NumPy arrays, and generates two separate plots: one for the current clamp response (voltage over time) and another for the stimulus series (current over time). The plots are labeled with titles and axis labels for clarity. Finally, the file resources are closed.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
There are two plots generated by this cell.

The first plot, titled "Current Clamp Response," displays the voltage response over time.  The x-axis is labeled "Time (s)" and represents the time in seconds. The y-axis is labeled "Current (V)" and represents the current in Volts. A blue line represents the current clamp response data, and there is a legend indicating that the blue line represents "Response".

The second plot, titled "Stimulus Series," displays the stimulus current over time. The x-axis is labeled "Time (s)" and represents the time in seconds. The y-axis is labeled "Current (A)" and represents the current in Amperes. A green line represents the stimulus data, and there is a legend indicating that the green line represents "Stimulus".

ISSUES:
The y-axis label on the first plot is "Current (V)" which is incorrect -- it should be "Voltage (V)" or "Membrane Potential (V)".

Cell 9
==========

OVERVIEW:
This cell provides a brief summary of what has been accomplished in the notebook, stating that current clamp responses and stimulus series were visualized. It also suggests that further analysis could be performed on other datasets or using different techniques within the Dandiset.
IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:
None
ISSUES:
None
